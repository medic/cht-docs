Some CHT Core features can be enabled for specific users only. This can be particularly helpful for features that require training. The updated or "new" version will generally be the system default, but users can be configured to see the "old" version. If you do nothing when you upgrade, users will automatically start seeing the new version.

> [!NOTE] 
> Feature flags are used primarily as a way to phase in updates. The old version should be considered deprecated and will be completely removed in a future release.

## Configuration

If the specific CHT Core feature supports feature flagging, users can be configured to see the "old" version by means of a [permission]({{< ref "building/reference/app-settings/user-permissions" >}}). The permission can be added to existing Roles, or for more granular control and rolling out by cohorts, you can create a new Role with the one permission and add that Role to desired users. The permission will not be included in `app_settings` automatically so if you want it to be selectable from the Admin app user interface, you will need to add it to `app_settings`.


## Roll-out Scenarios

The table below illustrates some potential rollout scenarios and recommended Actions.

Scenario | Actions
-- | -- 
[Default] All users see the "new" version once you upgrade | None, just upgrade.
All users see the "old" version once you upgrade. All users see the "new" version at the same time in the future. | Add the permission to all Roles before you upgrade. When you are ready to transition everyone to the the new version, just remove the permission form all Roles.
All users see the "old" version once you upgrade. Roll out the "new" version in cohorts over time. | Create a new Role with the one permission and add that role to all users. When you are ready to transition a cohort of users, remove the Role from that cohort.
Some cohorts see the "old" version/some see the "new" version once you upgrade.  All cohorts seeing the "old" version start seeing the "new" version at the same time. | Create a new Role with the one permission and add it to selected users. When you are ready to transition all cohorts to the "new" version, remove the Role from all users.
Some cohorts see the "old" version/some see the "new" version once you upgrade. Roll out the "new" version to applicable cohorts over time. | Create a new Role with the one permission and add it to selected users. When you are ready to transition a cohort of users, remove the Role from those users.
