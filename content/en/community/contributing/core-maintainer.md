  Who can commit directly to CHT repositories in GitHub
---

Historically only [Medic](https://medic.org/) teammates were given GitHub permissions to merge code into CHT repositories.  This is no longer the case!  Now, everyone is treated as an equal:  If you meet these requirements, you can commit code.  Medic teammates who already have maintainer status do not get exemptions - they've just already meet the requirements.

This is not just for the [CHT Core](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/) repository though!  We welcome maintainers want to [update the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) as well.  There's actually dozens of repositories that you can contribute to - [check them out](https://github.com/orgs/medic/repositories)!

If you have any questions about how this works in practice, please post a [question to the forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/community/10).

## Maintainer status on multiple repositories

If a community member would like access to more than one repository, they can just get 2 of the same (or different) existing maintainers of that repository to sign off on their nomination.  You can be a committer on as many repositories as you're interested in.

## When to remove a core maintainer

* 3 existing core maintainers agree you should no longer be a maintainer

This may because some or all of the following:
* You no longer attend round up calls

* It has been over 18 months since your last CHT related GitHub activity
* You have violated the [Code of Conduct](/community/contributing/code-of-conduct)
