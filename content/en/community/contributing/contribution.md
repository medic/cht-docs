A contribution is any meaningful action: technical or non-technical, that advances the CHT’s mission of improving community health. All contributions must add measurable value, adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/), and align with the CHT’s core goals.

### Ways to Contribute

- **Technical contributions** include:

  - **[Design](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/design/):** Create wireframes, user & system workflows, or solution documentation.  
  - **Security:** [Disclose vulnerabilities](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/disclosing-vulnerabilities/).  
  - **[Testing](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code/core/automated-tests/#contributing-section):** File bug reports, improve test coverage, or perform user acceptance testing.

- **Non-technical contributions** include:  
  - **[Documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/docs/):** Write guides, create tutorials, or translate the CHT to make it accessible to more users.
  - **Community Support**: Answer questions on the [CHT Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/), provide user feedback, or advocate for the CHT.
