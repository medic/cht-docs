  What is a contribution?
---

A contribution is any meaningful action: technical or non-technical—that advances the CHT’s mission of improving community health. All contributions must add measurable value, adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/), and align with the CHT’s core goals.
