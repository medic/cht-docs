If you're ready to start contributing and have experience, please jump in!  We have a quick start guide below.

If you've never contributed to the CHT before, please see our [First time Contributors Guide]({{% ref "community/contributing/first-time-contributors" %}})


## Quick Start

### Code

Before you start coding a new change you suggest to the CHT, [raise an issue](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/new/choose) or [start a conversation](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org) about the change you want to make. Then:

1. Read the CHT [Development Workflow]({{% ref "community/contributing/code/workflow" %}}) and [Code Style Guide]({{% ref "community/contributing/code/style-guide" %}}) 
2. [Setup]({{% ref "community/contributing/code/core/dev-environment" %}}) your development environment
3. Make sure your pull request's (PR) tests all pass. Failures need to be addressed before we can merge your code.
4. Provide detail about the issue you are solving on the PR. Please reference any existing issues using medic/<repo>#<issue number>
5. Our CI will automatically schedule a build; monitor the build to ensure it passes.
6. Your PR will be reviewed by a maintainer. Expect at least one change requested - don't be offended if your change doesn't get accepted on the first try!

### Docs

Help us maintain the quality of the CHT documentation by [submitting a PR](https://github.com/medic/cht-docs) with any suggested changes. See the [Documentation Style Guide]({{% ref "community/contributing/docs/style-guide" %}}), then open a pull request with your suggested changes or additions. For simple changes, use the "Edit this page" link shown in the upper right of every page.
