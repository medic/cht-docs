**What is a contribution?**

A contribution is any meaningful action: technical or non-technical—that advances the CHT’s mission of improving community health. Technical contributions include coding (bug fixes, feature development), design (wireframes, workflows), testing (bug reports, QA), and infrastructure (DevOps, security). Non-technical efforts encompass documentation, translations, user feedback, and community engagement. Examples range from submitting a pull request or creating localized guides to co-designing features or reporting vulnerabilities. All contributions must add measurable value, follow ethical guidelines, and align with the CHT’s goals. Below are starting guides for contributors.
