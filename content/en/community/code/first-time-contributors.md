  Getting to your first commit in the CHT suite of software
---


The [Development](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/support/development/7) section of the forum is a great place to introduce yourself and ask questions. Or you can also jump right in:
- [Get up to speed]({{% ref "technical-resources" %}}) with the technologies and tools used by the CHT. Additionally, the [Technology Radar for CHT Contributors](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/cht-tech-radar-contributors/) gives an overview of the technologies used to build the CHT tools.
- [Request a demo](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) to test out the CHT (login details will be emailed to you).
- Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Help%20wanted%22) are a great place to start coding.

- [Share a new idea or question](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) on the Forum.

## Who this is for

Documentation already exists for everything from how to [compile]({{% ref "community/code/core/dev-environment" %}}) the CHT from source, to how to [build](https://github.com/medic/cht-docs/blob/main/README.md) the docs site locally or how to [install]({{% ref "hosting/analytics/setup-docker-compose" %}}) CHT Sync via Docker.  However, where do you start?  What if you've never contributed to an open source project before? This guide helps the newcomer make their first contribution.

From the top, dive into each topic when interest you.  If you already know with the topic - skip it! No one is going to verify if new contributors followed these steps, but maybe they'll help those who need an extra tip or three.

## What is the CHT

Before you write a line of code or help improve that documentation, it's important to understand the larger picture of the CHT.


Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/labels/Help%20wanted) are a great place to start.

Looking for other ways to help? You can also:
* Improve our [documentation](#improving-our-documentation)
