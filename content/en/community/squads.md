## What is a squad?

A CHT Squad is a small, action-oriented team that works together to solve high-priority needs for the community. These teams bring together developers, designers, project managers, and other contributors to build and implement new features and improvements for the CHT.

## How squads work
When a community-proposed improvement shows potential for broad impact, we invite the wider community to collaborate. Members can express interest in contributing to discussions, design, development, testing and/or funding. Below are the steps how a squad works:
- Collaborative by design: Anyone can join - whether you are an experienced community contributor or just getting started with the CHT
- Transparent process: Regular meetings and shared public notes and documentation to keep everyone informed
- Flexible contributions: Help in whatever way works for you - coding, design, testing, or documentation

## Starting a squad: key requirements
For a squad to succeed, **dedicated development capacity should be secured upfront**. This means:
- **Resource Commitment**: Interested members can pledge either:
   - Engineering time: Developers with relevant skills committing hours/week, or
   - Funding: Budget to pay community developers (prioritizing CHT contributors).
- **Clear Ownership:** Squads will be launched when specific developers are identified and onboarded.

## Why join a squad?
- Work on meaningful projects that make a real difference
- Learn from and collaborate with other community members
- Help shape the future of the CHT


## What are the different stages in a squad?
Squads evolve through stages, and anyone can start contributing at any stage - no matter their experience level. Here are the various stages:

### 1. ‚ú® Emerging
An idea sparks! The community identifies a feature or improvement with broad potential.

  **Outputs**:
  - Exploratory discussions
  - Partners and contributors aligned
  - The [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/) is shared with all squad members

### 2. üßëüèº‚Äçüé® Early Design Discussion
Feasibility meets vision. Teams explore technical requirements, timelines, and design approaches.

  **Outputs**:
  - Wireframes or prototypes
  - Resource commitments
  - Preliminary scope and timeline

### 3.  Requirements & Design
Turning ideas into action. Clear specs and mockups are finalized for development, as well as technical design.

  **Outputs**:
  - Documented requirements
  - Approved design doc

### 4. üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª Development/Building
building the solution. 
Feature implementation based on agreed-upon designs.

  **Output**:
  - Working software (GitHub pull requests)

### 5. üì≤ Testing
Ensuring quality. Rigorous manual/automated testing verifies functionality.

  **Outputs**:
  - Test reports
  - Verified software

### 6. üí™üèº Release
The functionality is released and ready to create an impact in the real world. Features can be deployed to users.

  **Output**:
  - Software release

### 7. ‚úÖ Done
Mission accomplished. The project meets all goals and the related tasks are marked complete.
