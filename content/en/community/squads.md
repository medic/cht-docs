## What is a squad?

A CHT Squad is a small, action-oriented team that works together to solve high-priority needs for the community. These teams bring together developers, designers, project managers, and other contributors to build and implement new features and improvements for the CHT.

## How squads work
When a community-proposed improvement shows potential for broad impact, we invite the wider community to collaborate. Members can express interest in contributing to discussions, design, development, testing and/or funding. Below are the steps how a squad works:
- Collaborative by design: Anyone can join - whether you are an experienced community contributor or just getting started with the CHT
- Transparent process: Regular meetings and shared public notes and documentation to keep everyone informed
- Flexible contributions: Help in whatever way works for you - coding, design, testing, or documentation

## Starting a squad: key requirements
For a squad to succeed, **dedicated development capacity should be secured upfront**. This means:
- **Resource Commitment**: Interested members can pledge either:
   - Engineering time: Developers with relevant skills committing hours/week, or
   - Funding: Budget to pay community developers (prioritizing CHT contributors).
- **Clear Ownership:** Squads will be launched when specific developers are identified and onboarded.

If you are interested in forming or starting a squad, here are the steps to follow:
- Share details about the topic/feature to be explored in the squad on the [forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/squads/34) to invite other interested community members to join the conversation.
- Reach out to specific community members who have previously discussed the topic or who you think may be interested.
- Reach out to the CHT Stewardship Team to allocate dedicated time during Round-up calls for sharing the initiative with the broader community.

### Kick off
 - Schedule a meeting with all stakeholders once the squad’s start date is confirmed.
 - The agenda for this meeting should include:
   - Introductions and role clarity.
   - Overview of squad objectives and desired outcomes.
   - Initial task assignments and ownership.
   - Agreement on a recurring meeting cadence (e.g., weekly/biweekly calls).
- Establish a communication channel
  - Create a dedicated Slack channel (or alternative platform, if preferred) for squad discussions.
  - Invite all core members and ensure access is granted promptly.
- Engage Advisory Roles
  - Extend invitations to domain experts, UX specialists, or other advisors as needed.
  - Clarify their involvement (e.g., periodic reviews, feedback sessions) even if they are not full-time contributors.


## Why join a squad?
- Work on meaningful projects that make a real difference
- Learn from and collaborate with other community members
- Help shape the future of the CHT


## What are the different stages in a squad?
Squads evolve through stages, and anyone can start contributing at any stage - no matter their experience level. Here are the various stages:

### 1. ✨ Emerging
An idea sparks! The community identifies a feature or improvement with broad potential.

  **Outputs**:
  - Exploratory discussions
  - Partners and contributors aligned
  - The [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/) is shared with all squad members

### 2. 🧑🏼‍🎨 Early Design Discussion
Feasibility meets vision. Teams explore technical requirements, timelines, and design approaches.

  **Outputs**:
  - Wireframes or prototypes
  - Resource commitments
  - Preliminary scope and timeline

### 3. 💡 Requirements & Design
Turning ideas into action. 
- Initial Deliverable: Produce a comprehensive design document as the group's first output.
- Review Phase: Upon completing the initial draft, pause development to incorporate feedback—share the document on the forum to gather broad community input/feedback.

  **Outputs**:
  - Documented requirements
  - Clear specs and mockups are finalized for development
  - Approved design doc
  - Technical design doc

Once the first iteration is complete, pause to incorporate feedback by announcing it on the forum for broad community review before proceeding.

### 4. 🧑🏽‍💻 Development/Building
- Development Kickoff
  - Begin feature implementation once the design document receives final approval
  - For collaborations:
    - Establish a single, authoritative development branch/workspace
    - Maintain transparency through frequent pushes to the public repository on GitHub

- Quality Assurance
  - Adhere to coding best practices including:
    - Comprehensive automated testing
    - Strict code quality standards
    - Detailed documentation
  - Conduct ongoing manual testing to identify and resolve issues early

- Collaborative Standards
  - Implement regular code reviews
  - Maintain clear contribution guidelines
  - Schedule periodic sync meetings for coordinating teams

  **Output**:
  - Working software (GitHub pull requests)

### 5. 📲 Testing
Ensuring quality. Rigorous manual/automated testing verifies functionality.

  **Outputs**:
  - Test reports
  - Verified software

### 6. 🛋️ Review
When the squad confirms the solution meets requirements, submit a PR for review and nominate an experienced CHT engineer to lead the technical assessment. After passing both technical review and allowing a few days for community feedback, merge the approved code.
**Outputs**: 
- PR posted with testing instructions in the forum for community validation.
- Merged contribution with documented community input.

### 7. 💪🏼 Release
The functionality is released and ready to create an impact in the real world. Features can be deployed to users.

  **Output**:
  - Software release

### 7. ✅ Done
Mission accomplished. The project meets all goals and the related tasks are marked complete.
