## What is a squad?

A CHT Squad is a small, action-oriented team that works together to solve high-priority needs for the community. These teams bring together developers, designers, project managers, and other contributors to build and implement new features and improvements for the CHT.

## How squads work

- Collaborative by design: Anyone can join - whether you are an experienced community contributor or just getting started with the CHT
- Transparent process: Regular meetings and shared public notes and documentation to keep everyone informed
- Flexible contributions: Help in whatever way works for you - coding, design, testing, or documentation

## Why join a squad?
- Work on meaningful projects that make a real difference
- Learn from and collaborate with other community members
- Help shape the future of the CHT


## What are the different stages in a squad?
Squads evolve through stages, and anyone can start contributing at any stage - no matter their experience level. Here are the various stages:

### 1. Emerging
An idea sparks! The community identifies a feature or improvement with broad potential.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Exploratory discussions
      - ✅ Partners and contributors aligned
      - ✅ The [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/) is shared with all squad members

2. Early Design Discussion
Feasibility meets vision. Teams explore technical requirements, timelines, and design approaches.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Wireframes or prototypes
      - ✅ Resource commitments
      - ✅ Preliminary scope and timeline

3. Requirements & Design
Turning ideas into action. Clear specs and mockups are finalized for development, as well as technical design.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Documented requirements
      - ✅ Approved design doc

4. Development/Building:
building the solution. 
Feature implementation based on agreed-upon designs.

      **Output**:
      - ✅ Working software (GitHub pull requests)

### 5. Testing
Ensuring quality. Rigorous manual/automated testing verifies functionality.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Test reports
      - ✅ Verified software

### 6. Release
The functionality is released and ready to create an impact in the real world. Features can be deployed to users.

      **Output**:
      - ✅ Live deployment!

### 7.  Done
Mission accomplished. The project meets all goals and the related tasks are marked complete.
