## What is a squad?

A CHT Squad is a small, action-oriented team that works together to solve high-priority needs for the community. These teams bring together developers, designers, project managers, and other contributors to build and implement new features and improvements for the CHT.

## How squads work

- Collaborative by design: Anyone can join - whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started
- Transparent process: Regular meetings, shared notes, and public GitHub repositories keep everyone informed
- Flexible contributions: Help in whatever way works for you - coding, design, testing, or documentation

**Why Join a Squad?**
- Work on meaningful projects that make a real difference
- Learn from and collaborate with other community members
- Help shape the future of the CHT


**The CHT Squad Journey**
Squads evolve through stages, and anyone can contribute—no matter their experience level. Here are the various stages:

1. ✨ Emerging
An idea sparks! The community identifies a feature or improvement with broad potential.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Exploratory discussions
      - ✅ Partners and contributors aligned
      - ✅ The [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/) is shared with all squad members

2. **🧑🏼‍🎨** Early Design Discussion
Feasibility meets vision. Teams explore technical requirements, timelines, and design approaches.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Wireframes or prototypes
      - ✅ Resource commitments
      - ✅ Preliminary scope and timeline

3. **💪🏼** Requirements & Design
Turning ideas into action. Clear specs and mockups are finalized for development.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Documented requirements
      - ✅ Approved design doc

4. **🛠️** Development/Building:
building the solution. 
Developers implement features based on agreed designs.

      **Output**:
      - ✅ Working software (GitHub pull requests)

5. **🧪** Testing
Ensuring quality. Rigorous manual/automated testing verifies functionality.

      **Outputs**:
      - ✅ Test reports
      - ✅ Verified software

6. **🚀** Release
Impact in the real world. Features are deployed to real-world users and later merged into core CHT releases.

      **Output**:
      - ✅ Live deployment!

7. **📊** Done
Mission accomplished. The project meets all goals and is marked complete.
