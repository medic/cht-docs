  How to make your first contribution to the CHT 
---

## Who this is for

Documentation already exists for everything from how to [compile]({{% ref "contribute/code/core/dev-environment" %}}) the CHT from source, to how to [build](https://github.com/medic/cht-docs/blob/main/README.md) the docs site locally or how to [install]({{% ref "hosting/analytics/setup-docker-compose" %}}) CHT Sync via Docker.  However, where do you start?  What if you've never contributed to an open source project before? This guide helps the newcomer make their first contribution. 

From the top, dive into each topic when interest you.  If you already know with the topic - skip it! No one is going to verify if new contributors followed these steps, but maybe they'll help those who need an extra tip or three.

## What is the CHT

Before you write a line of code or help improve that documentation, it's important to understand the larger picture of the CHT.
