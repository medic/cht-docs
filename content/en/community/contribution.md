**What is a contribution?**

A contribution is any meaningful action: technical or non-technical—that advances the CHT’s mission of improving community health. 

- **Technical contributions** include:  
  - **Code:** Bug fixes, feature development, or example apps.  
  - **Design:** Wireframes, workflows, or solution documentation.  
  - **Infrastructure:** DevOps automation, security enhancements.  
  - **Testing:** Bug reports, test coverage, or user acceptance feedback.  

- **Non-technical contributions** include:  
  - **Documentation:** Guides, tutorials, or translations.  
  - **Community:** User feedback, co-design input, or advocacy.  

All contributions must add measurable value, adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/community/contributing/code-of-conduct/), and align with CHT’s goals.
