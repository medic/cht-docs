{{% alert title="Note" %}} This guide assumes you are a CHT Core developer wanting to run the CHT Core from source code to make commits to the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-core). To set up your environment for developing apps, see the [app guide]({{< relref "hosting/3.x/app-developer.md" >}}).

To deploy the CHT in production, see either [AWS hosting]({{< relref "hosting/3.x/ec2-setup-guide.md" >}}) or [Self hosting]({{< relref "hosting/3.x/self-hosting.md" >}}){{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
These steps apply to both 3.x and 4.x CHT core development, unless stated otherwise.

## The Happy Path Installation

CHT Core development can be done on Linux, macOS, or Windows (using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)). This CHT Core developer guide will have you install NodeJS, npm, and CouchDB (via Docker) on your local workstation.

### Install NodeJS, npm, and Docker

First, update your current packages and install some supporting tools:

_(Node {{< param nodeVersion >}} is the environment used to run the CHT server in production, so this is the recommended version of Node to use for development.)_

{{< tabpane persistLang=false lang=shell >}}
{{< tab header="Linux (Ubuntu)" >}}
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade
sudo apt -y install xsltproc curl uidmap jq python2 git make g++
# Use NVM to install NodeJS:
export nvm_version=`curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/latest | jq -r .name`
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/$nvm_version/install.sh | $SHELL
. ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
nvm install {{< param nodeVersion >}}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="macOS" >}}
# Uses Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
brew update
brew install curl jq pyenv git make node@{{< param nodeVersion >}} gcc
# Python no longer included by default in macOS >12.3 
pyenv install 2.7.18
pyenv global 2.7.18
echo "eval \"\$(pyenv init --path)\"" >> ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
. ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Windows (WSL2)" >}}
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade
sudo apt -y install xsltproc curl uidmap jq python2 git make g++
# Use NVM to install NodeJS:
export nvm_version=`curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/latest | jq -r .name`
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/$nvm_version/install.sh | $SHELL
. ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
nvm install {{< param nodeVersion >}}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

Now let's ensure NodeJS {{< param nodeVersion >}} and npm {{< param npmVersion >}} were installed. This should output version {{< param nodeVersion >}}.x.x for NodeJS and {{< param npmVersion >}}.x.x for `npm`:

```shell
node -v && npm -v
```

Install Docker:

{{< read-content file="_partial_docker_setup.md" >}}

### CHT Core Cloning and Setup

Clone the main CHT Core repo from GitHub and change directories into it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/medic/cht-core ~/cht-core
cd ~/cht-core
```

Install dependencies and perform other setup tasks via an `npm` command. Note this command may take many minutes. Be patient!

```shell
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

To finalise setting up any remaining dependencies build the project by running: 
```shell
npm run build-dev
```

Every time you run any `npm` or `node` commands, it will expect `COUCH_NODE_NAME` and `COUCH_URL` environment variables to be set:

```shell
echo "export COUCH_NODE_NAME=nonode@nohost">> ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
echo "export COUCH_URL=http://medic:password@localhost:5984/medic">> ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
. ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
```

To ensure these to exports and sourcing your rc file worked, echo the values back out. You should see `nonode@nohost` and `http://medic:password@localhost:5984/medic`:

```shell
echo $COUCH_NODE_NAME && echo $COUCH_URL
```

### CouchDB

CouchDB execution differs depending on whether you're running CHT 3.x or 4.x. Follow the instructions in one of the sections below.

#### CouchDB Setup in CHT 3.x

Note this will run in the background and store its data in `/home/YOUR-USER/cht-docker`. The login for your CHT instance will be `medic` and the password will be `password`:

```shell
docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -p 5986:5986 --name medic-couchdb -e COUCHDB_USER=medic -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password -v ~/cht-docker/local.d:/opt/couchdb/data -v ~/cht-docker/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d apache/couchdb:2
```

Let's ensure CouchDB is set up with a test `curl` call. This should show "nonode@nohost" in JSON:

```shell
curl -X GET "http://medic:password@localhost:5984/_membership" | jq
```

#### CouchDB Setup in CHT 4.x

Create a `docker-compose.yml` and `couchdb-override.yml` files under the `~/cht-docker` folder with this code:

```
mkdir -p ~/cht-docker
curl -s -o ~/cht-docker/docker-compose.yml https://staging.dev.medicmobile.org/_couch/builds_4/medic:medic:master/docker-compose/cht-couchdb.yml
cat > ~/cht-docker/couchdb-override.yml << EOF
version: '3.9'
services:
    couchdb:
        ports:
          - "5984:5984"
          - "5986:5986"
EOF
```

Now you can start CouchDB. The login for your CHT instance will be `medic` and the `password` will be password:

```shell
cd ~/cht-docker 
COUCHDB_USER=medic COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f couchdb-override.yml up -d
```

### Developing

Now you have everything installed and can begin development! You'll need three separate terminals when doing development. 

In the first terminal we'll compile and deploy the web application by running:

```shell
cd ~/cht-core && npm run build-dev-watch
```

Be **very** patient until you see:

> "Waiting..."

In the second terminal we'll start the API nodejs service by running:

```shell
cd ~/cht-core && npm run dev-api
```

Finally, in a 3rd terminal we'll start the Sentinel nodejs service by running:

```shell
cd ~/cht-core && npm run dev-sentinel
```

That's it!  Now when you edit code in your IDE, it will automatically reload.  You can see the CHT running locally here: [http://localhost:5988/](http://localhost:5988/)

When you're done with development you can `ctrl + c` in the three terminals and stop the CouchDB container with `docker stop medic-couchdb`.  When you want to resume development later, run `docker start medic-couchdb` and re-run the three terminal commands.

## Other Path Troubleshooting

If you weren't able to follow [the happy path above](#the-happy-path-installation), here are some details about the developer install that may help you troubleshoot what went wrong.

### Prerequisites

If you had issues with following the above steps, check out these links for how to install the prerequisites on your specific platform:

* [Node.js {{< param nodeVersion >}}.x](https://nodejs.org/) & [npm {{< param npmVersion >}}.x.x](https://npmjs.com/) - Both of which we recommend installing [via `nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
* [xsltproc](http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html) 
* [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.3.1/install/index.html) - OS package instead of in Docker - you **MUST** use CouchDB 2.x! We still strongly recommend using Docker.

### Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04's default `apt` repositories do not know about `python2`. This means when you go to install run the first `apt install` command above, you see an error:

```
E: Unable to locate package python2
```

To fix this, change the `apt install` call to this:

```
sudo apt -y install xsltproc curl uidmap jq python git make g++
```

As well, after you install docker, and go to run the rootless script `dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh`, you might see this error:

```
[ERROR] Failed to start docker.service. Run `journalctl -n 20 --no-pager --user --unit docker.service` to show the error log.
```

The workaround, unfortunately, is to just start your CouchDB Docker container with sudo: `sudo docker run...`.

### CouchDB on Docker Details

Breaking down the command from [the above section]({{< relref "#couchdb" >}}), here's a generic version that doesn't include hard coded paths:

```shell
docker run -d -p 5984:5984 -p 5986:5986 --name medic-couchdb -e COUCHDB_USER=medic -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password -v <data path>:/opt/couchdb/data -v <config path>:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d apache/couchdb:2
```

Parts of the command:
- `--name` creates a container called `medic-couchdb`. You can name it whatever you want, but this is how you refer to it later
- `-e` sets an environment variable inside the container. Two are set here, for a user and password for the initial admin user.
- `-v` maps where couchdb stores data to your local file system to ensure persistence without depending on the container, using the path *before* the `:` (the path after the colon is the internal path inside the docker image). This should be somewhere you have write access to, and want this data to be stored. The second mounted volume is for the couch configuration, which will retain settings if your container is removed. This is especially important after running the command to secure the instance (done in steps below).
- `apache/couchdb:2` will install the latest package for CouchDB 2.x

Once this downloads and starts, you will need to [initialise CouchDB](http://localhost:5984/_utils/#/setup) as noted in [their install instructions](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.3.1/setup/index.html#setup).

You can use `docker stop medic-couchdb` to stop it and `docker start medic-couchdb` to start it again. Remember that you'll need to start it whenever you restart your OS, which might not be the case if you use a normal OS package. `docker rm medic-couchdb` will totally remove the container.

Medic recommends you familiarise yourself with other Docker commands to make docker image and container management clearer.

### Required environment variables

Medic needs the following environment variables to be declared:
- `COUCH_URL`: the full authenticated url to the `medic` DB. Locally this would be  `http://myadminuser:myadminpass@localhost:5984/medic`
- `COUCH_NODE_NAME`: the name of your CouchDB's node. The Docker image default is `nonode@nohost`. Other installations may use `couchdb@127.0.0.1`. You can find out by querying [CouchDB's membership API](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/server/common.html#membership)
- (optional) `COUCHDB_USER`: the name of your CouchDB's user. The Docker image default is `medic`
- (optional) `COUCHDB_PASSWORD`: the credentials of your CouchDB user. The Docker image default is `password`
- (optional) `API_PORT`: the port API will run on. If not defined, the port defaults to `5988`
- (optional) `CHROME_BIN`: only required if tests complain that they can't find Chrome or if you want to run a specific version of the Chrome webdriver.

How to permanently define environment variables depends on your OS and shell (e.g. for bash you can put them `~/.bashrc`). You can temporarily define them with `export`:

```shell
export COUCH_NODE_NAME=nonode@nohost
export COUCH_URL=http://myadminuser:myadminpass@localhost:5984/medic
```

## Tests

Refer to [the testing doc](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/TESTING.md) in the GitHub repo.

## nginx-local-ip

[`nginx-local-ip`](https://github.com/medic/nginx-local-ip) is a local proxy that keeps all traffic local, and runs without latency or throttling. If sharing your local CHT instance is not required, it is the recommended method to add a valid SSL certificate (rather than `ngrok` or similar).

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/medic/nginx-local-ip.git`
1. `cd` into the new directory: `cd nginx-local-ip`
1. Assuming your IP is `192.168.0.3`, start `nginx-local-ip` to connect to:
   * The CHT API running via `npm run` or `horti`, execute `APP_URL=http://192.168.0.3:5988 docker compose up` and then access it at `https://192-168-0-3.local-ip.medicmobile.org/`.
   * The CHT API running via `docker`, the ports are remapped, so execute `HTTP=8080 HTTPS=8443 APP_URL=https://192.168.0.3 docker compose up` and then access it at `https://192-168-0-3.local-ip.medicmobile.org:8443/`.
2. The HTTP/HTTPS ports (`80`/`443`) need to accept traffic from the IP address of your host machine and your local webapp port (e.g. `5988`) needs to accept traffic from the IP address of the `nginx-local-ip` container (on the Docker network). If you are using the UFW firewall (in a Linux environment) you can allow traffic on these ports with the following commands:

(Since local IP addresses can change over time, ranges are used in these rules so that the firewall configuration does not have to be updated each time a new address is assigned.)

```shell
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 80,443
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from  172.16.0.0/16 to any port 5988
```

## Remote Proxies

`ngrok` and `pagekite` are remote proxies that route local traffic between your client and the CHT via a remote SSL terminator. While easy and handy, they introduce latency and are sometimes throttled. Always use `nginx-local-ip` when you need a TLS certificate and only use these when you need to share your dev instance.

### ngrok

1. Create an [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/), download and install the binary, then link your computer to your ngrok account.
2. Start `ngrok` to connect to:
   - The CHT API running via `npm run` or `horti`, execute `./ngrok http 5988`
   - The CHT API running via `docker`, execute `./ngrok http 443`
3. Access the app using the https address shown (e.g. `https://YOUR-NGROK-NAME.ngrok.io`, replacing `YOUR-NGROK-NAME` with what you signed up with).

**Note:** The service worker cache preload sometimes fails due to connection throttling (thereby causing an `ngrok` failure at startup).

### pagekite

1. Create a [pagekite account](https://pagekite.net/signup/), download and install the python script.
1. Start pagekite (be sure to replace `YOUR-PAGEKIT-NAME` with the URL you signed up for) to connect to:
  * The CHT API running via `npm run` or `horti`, execute `python pagekite.py 5988 YOUR-PAGEKIT-NAME.pagekite.me`
  * The CHT API running via `docker`, execute `python pagekite.py 443 YOUR-PAGEKIT-NAME.pagekite.me`
1. Access the app using the https address shown (e.g. `https://YOUR-PAGEKIT-NAME.pagekite.me`).
