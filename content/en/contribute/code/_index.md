---

The [Development](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/developement/7) section of the forum is a great place to introduce yourself and ask questions. Or you can also jump right in:
- Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Help%20wanted%22) are a great place to start. 
- Learn to [build and host apps]({{% ref "apps" %}}), and share your experiences
- [Share a new idea or question](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) on our Forum

The CHT community welcomes first-time contributors and experts alike. All comment, questions, and ideas are welcome!
