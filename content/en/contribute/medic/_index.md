  Compilation of guidelines and product development processes used at Medic 
---

[Medic](https://medic.org) works with CHT partners and health workers to design, build, and maintain the Community Health Toolkit and its open source tools. Medic's Product team manages the entire software development life-cycle to understand problems, capture requirements, design and build modular software systems, and document everything along the way.

This section contains internal processes, best practices and guidelines used *so far* in the Product team at Medic.

**Also, improvements and ideas for this doc site are [always welcome]({{% ref "contribute/docs" %}})!**
