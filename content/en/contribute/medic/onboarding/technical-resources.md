This page contains materials that will help a CHT Contributor to master all the technical details they need to be successful when building tools related to the CHT. For Medic team members, this content is complimentary on a technical level to the Onboarding documents shared by the Internal Operations team. 
Keep in mind that this is a living document, and every contributor is encouraged to add to it when identifying learning opportunities that can set them up for success with the CHT. The main goal here is to provide the technical people who are new to the CHT with a list of resources that could be beneficial for them in both the short and long term. However, the expectation is not to complete every course listed in this document but instead to share some resources that other contributors found helpful. It is valid if you prefer to use other training material, as long as you cover the skill/topic during the onboarding. That means you will need to learn JavaScript, TypeScript, Docker, CouchDB, and others mentioned in the “Skills” column, as you will use them in your day-to-day activities, and the list provided in the “Resources” column is meant to support you in this. It is OK if you prefer to learn with alternative resources.

Some of the suggestions below could be for internal courses and/or material created and maintained by other teammates at Medic, free resources on the internet, or paid courses, which for Medic teammates could be considered as part of the [Professional Development Benefit](https://www.notion.so/Professional-Development-f5fc299ecf984dacbd65100af100ed14) at Medic.

## Developer Workshops
There is a Slack channel *#cht-dev-workshop* for CHT community members to grow their coding skills. The group meets on a weekly basis. The primary goal of this group is to discuss with other developers and have a fun, open discussion on how the provided solutions can be improved, while also having the opportunity to connect with people from other teams. Even though this is optional, it is highly encouraged to join and participate frequently.
