This document is meant to serve as a point of conversation, with a wide range of topics to be discussed. Many things are not in any particular order. The goal is to convey a general “lay of the land” so someone starting can see a lot of what’s out there without having to be surprised each day as new things pop up.
First, some general context…
What is the CHT?
Web application that runs inside an Android app (as a WebView)
Offline first - for real
Community of people and organizations
Teams at Medic
Product (you are here)
Programs
Research
Internal OPS
External Affairs
Lifecycle of an “app” being built
Programs team starts relationship with an organization
Service designers and app developers figure out how they want their system to work
App developers take latest version of the CHT and build the app for the organization
Android flavor deployed to get branded app onto CHW devices / deployment
Dashboards are set up in Klipfolio
Go!
App developers make ongoing enhancements
App upgraded as new versions of CHT are available
Now, all the things…
🫂 People/Team
Distributed things 
Without some effort, it’s easy for things to feel lonely, isolated, etc.
Default to asynchronous things
Respect teammate time zones (including your own!)
Expensify
Follow up to make sure things get through 
Funding
Restricted
Clicktime
Unrestricted
Travel 
Meetups at your own risk are fine
Meetings
A few mandatory calls
Organization-wide calls are recorded
No recurring meetings on Fridays
Product team doc
🧰 Process
SRE
Support
Not on-call
We’re offline first, so not every outage calls for immediate action/resolution
Engineering work
Archv3 (cht-core 4.0 version)
Development
Basic current process:
Take ticket (GitHub issue from a board)
Code something up on a branch
Open pull request
Move ticket to “Ready for AT (Acceptance Testing)”
Upon testing passing, merge and delete branch
Get QA engineers involved early in the process!
Releases
Backwards compatibility matters a lot
Slower moving (working to change this)
Quality matters a lot
The main repos to look at
cht-core
cht-conf
cht-android 
cht-sync 
couch2pg
cht-pipeline
GitHub 
Tons of stuff happens here.
Recommendation: Set up your reminders/notifications 
A few important boards 
SRE Engineering
SRE Support
Ecosystem (probably, the most important board for you)
Allies Workstream
Care Teams Workstream
Test Automation
QA
Doing a lot of automation
Trying to move from manual AT and release testing to fully automated
Trying out quality assistance
Faster start-to-live 
Avoiding silos and shifting of responsibilities (coding and quality)
📲 Product
The forum
We’re trying to keep this active
Encourage teammates to post and answer questions there instead of slack when the public might benefit
Expecting you to be proactive and support the team with checking forum posts and helping when questions arise
Partners
Medic-hosted
Self-hosted
Technical partners
The new product team process
We’re starting to do Continuous Discovery
Trying to follow closely with the book by Teresa Torres
Groups (“Focused Groups”) within the product team to focus on specific groups of users
Allies
Care Teams
Infrastructure
Ecosystem (you’ll be part of this)

The engineers
This is the main part of the role and why you were hired. Do your thing! :) 
Let’s talk about each individual to give you a good base to start from
Distributed things
Without some effort, it’s easy for things to feel lonely, isolated, etc.
Default to asynchronous things
Respect teammate time zones (including your own!)
Some with especially poor overlap started at Medic with an understanding of a single 
Expensify
Make sure people submit stuff!
Follow up to make sure things get through 
SRE

Not on-call

Challenges
Getting to archv3
Getting a consistent process 
Focused Groups
Outcomes over outputs
Continuous Discovery - Trying to follow closely with the book by Teresa Torres with a couple big adjustments to accommodate for slow-moving partners.
It is critical that engineers work with this process. Think of it as the opposite of disengaged ticket-takers.
Development
Old process (that we’re still doing sometimes):
Take ticket (GitHub issue from a board)
Code something up on a branch
Open pull request
Move ticket to “Ready for AT”
Upon testing passing, merge and delete branch
Releases
Backwards compatibility matters a lot
Can feel slow at times, but we’re making a lot of progress here. See above about how Focused Groups work.
Quality matters a lot
The main repos to look at
cht-core
cht-conf
couch2pg
medic-android 
Data engineering -> software engineering
Workflow management 
Dashboards
QA
Pushing to do a lot more automation
Still does manual AT and release testing
Trying out quality assistance
Faster start-to-live 
Avoiding silos and shifting of responsibilities (coding and quality)

Travel 
Current policy was recently updated to allow travel again. Previously was at full stop for COVID. Still, no one is required to travel. Opportunities come up, but it is 100% teammate choice to go or not.
Full-team meetup being scheduled for Q1 2023. See note above.
