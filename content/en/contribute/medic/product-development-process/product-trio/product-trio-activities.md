  Common Activities of the Product Trio 
---

The following items represent common activities that members of a Product Trio will do in the Product Development Process. Depending on what is underway, some of these may happen each week, but many parts happen on-demand. For example, interviewing is an ongoing process of gathering information, but the group may not start building a new solution each week.

The following activities should be performed in order, by all trio members:

## Empathize
* **Partner alignment**: Understand initiatives Partners are planning in their roadmap and identify areas of overlap across health programs
* **User interviews**: Learn about end users’ recent experiences with the CHT and any workarounds they’ve used to uncover potential unknowns
* **Learning agendas**: Scoped interviews to learn more about specific topics of interest
* **Partner working sessions**: Understand how users arrived at their current issues and offer guidance in troubleshooting
* **Service design feedback**: Learn about feedback they have heard in the field
* **Customer effort survey**: Align with Community’s App Developer survey to understand the ease of use of doing key tasks with the CHT using a scale to understand the ease of each

## Define

* **Synthesis session**: Nuggets collected from the Empathize phase are synthesized into Opportunity Statements, broken down into subcategories if necessary
* **Define desired outcome**: Align on what impact to achieve based on MoH needs and what the synthesis sessions have uncovered as our most impactful opportunity and how we might measure it

## Ideate

* **Story mapping**: Brainstorm different ways we might achieve our desired outcome
* **Choose solution**: Discuss story maps, vote for the solution that is likeliest to achieve desired outcome
* **Validate with product leadership**: Loop in product leadership for gut check and to ensure full alignment

## Prototype and test

* **Validate** assumptions: Create mockups to usability test with end users
* **Iterate**: Update mockups as per user feedback

## Implement and measure

* **Build**: Build the thing and get it deployed
* **Measure**: Use metrics previously defined to measure impact
