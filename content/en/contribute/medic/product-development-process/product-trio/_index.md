  What is a Product Trio
---

A Product Trio refers to a product manager, a product designer and a software engineer working together to develop digital products in the scope of a Focused Working Group. Some Focused Working Groups have multiple software engineers contributing to the work. Additionally, other roles contribute to the Trio, such as UX Researcher and Quality Assuarance Engineer. In that sense, Product Trios are often a quartet or a quintet.
