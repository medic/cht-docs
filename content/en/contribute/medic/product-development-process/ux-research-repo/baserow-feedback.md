|Feedback|Status|
|--|--|
|From the main database view, it’s not convenient to get to the data entry forms. |TODO|
|When creating a new entity (org, interview subject, sample, etc…), it’s kind of annoying to check and see if it exists already.|TODO|
|The order of fields on the nugget entry screen isn’t really how i process nuggets. |TODO|
|Sometimes I’m not really sure if something should be a nugget|TODO|
|When i’m entering several nuggets, it’s  annoying to have to select the same “sample” over and over, plus… i can’t even copy/paste (paste works, copy doesn’t)|TODO|
|It’s hard to stay organized because i end up with a lot of tabs open. Even with two screens, i haven’t found a good way to be organized.|TODO|
|When i’m entering the interview subject record, i haven’t watched the video yet so there are a few fields i don’t know the answer to yet: started using the CHT, additional context, email, etc… this means i need to come back to this record later to update it (or create the “sample” first)|TODO|
|It’s annoying to enter a “Sample Title”|TODO|
|When processing a bunch of videos from a google drive folder, i need to remember which ones i’ve already done|TODO|
|Not everything relates specifically to available Journey/Acts but they are required fields.|TODO|
