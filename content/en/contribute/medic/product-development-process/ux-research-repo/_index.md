  How to keep track of product research
---

At Medic, we are implementing [baserow.io](http://baserow.io) as a place to keep all our product research. Baserow is very similar to [airtable.com](http://airtable.com), [getgrist.com](http://getgrist.com), and Google Sheets.

Our UX Research Repository is based off of concepts from WeWork‚Äôs [Polaris](https://tsharon.medium.com/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f) project. You can see an example of the Polaris (which uses Airtable) [here](https://www.airtable.com/universe/expShuhNMi0Oc0xpb/polaris-ux-nuggets).

The Baserow interface can be seen below. The items in the list on the left are ‚Äútables‚Äù that we have created. On the right is the ‚ÄúGrid‚Äù. It looks just like a spreadsheet and you can have multiple views of the same grid.
