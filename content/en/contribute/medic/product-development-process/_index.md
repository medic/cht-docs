The Medic Product Team is made up of 4 [Focused Groups](/contribute/medic/product-development-process/focused-groups). Each group is focused on a specific set of users of the software we build and has an aligned roadmap. Roadmaps are made up of defined initiatives, which map to goals and strategies. There is a big emphasis on working towards outcomes (not only *outputs*). Product teammates work together, across disciplines, to understand opportunities for improvement, find solutions that will have an impact, and then build, deploy, and measure them.

Each Focused Group has defined OKRs, which set their focus for a given quarter.

As part of responsible maintainers of a software system, software engineers also dedicate time to performing [Code Health](https://github.com/orgs/medic/projects/134/views/4) tasks. That ensures updates, upgrades, code enhancements, and small bugs are still handled while the team works on highly focused user-facing objectives.
