  How to contribute to the CHT tools and documentation
---

There are many ways to contribute to the Community Health Toolkit.

### Are you a developer?

The [Development](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/support/development/7) section of the forum is a great place to introduce yourself and ask questions. Or you can also jump right in:
- Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Help%20wanted%22) are a great place to start. 
- Learn to [build and host apps]({{% ref "apps" %}}), and share your experiences
- [Share a new idea or question](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) on our Forum

### Are you a researcher, designer, or health practitioner?

- [Share your expertise](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org) on our Forum
- Sign up for our [newsletter](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) to get the latest updates

### Are you a partner wondering how issues are prioritized?

There are a number of factors that contribute to prioritization of work. The following represents important factors that are often evaluated together to have the best chance for the largest impact if a partner will: 

* Upgrade to get the feature/bugfix
* Help validate, design and prototype the feature 
* Offer a time-bound funding opportunity which may influence when something gets done, provided that it aligns with the CHT product vision.
* Be blocked by it for a major release or expansion 
* Has users that are unable to use the CHT or experience it in a way that results in providing degraded care

Will get prioritized.  Further, internally, a ticket may be needed to facilitate a release or perform important upgrades as is critical to do in the maintenance of software.
