  How to contribute to the CHT tools and documentation
---

There are many ways to contribute to the Community Health Toolkit.

### Are you a developer?

The [Development](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/support/development/7) section of the forum is a great place to introduce yourself and ask questions. Or you can also jump right in:
- [Get up to speed]({{% ref "technical-resources" %}}) with the technologies and tools used by the CHT. Additionally, the [Technology Radar for CHT Contributors](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/cht-tech-radar-contributors/) gives an overview of the technologies used to build the CHT tools. 
- [Request a demo](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) to test out the CHT (login details will be emailed to you).
- Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22Help%20wanted%22) are a great place to start coding. 
- Learn to [build and host apps]({{% ref "building" %}}), and share your experiences.
- [Share a new idea or question](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) on the Forum.

### Are you a researcher, designer, or health practitioner?

- [Share your expertise](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org) on the Forum.
- Sign up for the [newsletter](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org/contact) to get the latest updates.

### Are you a partner wondering how issues are prioritized?

There are a number of factors that contribute to prioritization of work. The following represents important factors that are often evaluated together to have the best chance for the largest impact if a partner will: 

* Upgrade to get the feature/bugfix.
* Help validate, design and prototype the feature.
* Offer a time-bound funding opportunity which may influence when something gets done, provided that it aligns with the CHT product vision.
* Be blocked by it for a major release or expansion.
* Has users that are unable to use the CHT or experience it in a way that results in providing degraded care.

Will get prioritized.  Further, internally, a ticket may be needed to facilitate a release or perform important upgrades as is critical to do in the maintenance of software.


**Also, improvements and ideas for this doc site are [always welcome]({{% ref "contribute/docs" %}})!**
