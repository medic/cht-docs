  CHT Technical Radars for Contributors and Implementers
---

It is essential for a development toolkit such as the Community Health Toolkit to constantly improve and keep track with the latest useful innovations. It is important to openly look for innovations and new technologies and to question established technologies and methods every now and then.

A Technology Radar is a compilation of technologies and their adoption status in the context of the CHT.

## For Contributors
The [CHT Technology Radar for Contributors](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/cht-tech-radar-contributors/index.html) provides a useful view for developers to know what languages/tools/platforms/techniques to use while contributing to CHT tools themselves.

You can learn how to contribute to the CHT Technical Radar for Contributors in the [related GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-tech-radar-contributors).

## For Implementers
The [CHT Technology Radar for Implementers](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/cht-tech-radar-implementers/index.html) provides a view of all CHT-related tools and components so that CHT implementers can decide which to use when designing, developing, and hosting their CHT applications.
