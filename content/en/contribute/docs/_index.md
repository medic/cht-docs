  How to contribute to documentation for the CHT
---

This Community Health Toolkit documentation site is the primary resource for partners, app designers, and developers looking to learn about, as well as build digital health apps using the CHT. The documentation site includes product feature overviews, design resources, implementer guides, and technical reference documentation. 

Documentation is a collaborative effort among all community members. Contributors play an important role in:

* Making suggestions for improvements
* Reporting and correcting mistakes
* Updating text and examples for clarity
* Authoring guides and tutorials

The CHT community welcomes first-time contributors and experts alike. All comment, questions, and ideas are welcome!
