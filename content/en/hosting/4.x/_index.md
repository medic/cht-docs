> To get an overview on how these hosting solutions use `docker` and other key CHT concepts, be sure to read the [guide on a Local Setup]({{< relref "building/local-setup" >}}).

Before beginning any of these guides, be sure to meet all of the [CHT hosting requirements]({{< relref "hosting/requirements" >}}) first.

To host a production instance of CHT, use the [Production Hosting in CHT 4.x]({{< relref "hosting/4.x/production" >}}) guide. To do app development, see our [App Developer]({{< relref "hosting/4.x/app-developer" >}}) hosting guide.

To view 3.x hosting options, see the  [3.x hosting section]({{< relref "hosting/3.x" >}})
