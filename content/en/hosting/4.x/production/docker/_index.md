  Production Hosting CHT 4.x - Single CouchDB Node on Docker
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

{{< callout >}}
  This page is for a single node CHT 4.x instance and is the recommended solution for small deployments. If you want a more powerful setup, check out [the 4.x multi-node install docs]({{< relref "hosting/4.x/production/kubernetes" >}}). Docker Swarm, mentioned in prior versions of this document, is **no longer recommended**. For multinode CouchDB deployments utilizing multiple VMs, see [Kubernetes instructions]({{< relref "hosting/4.x/production/kubernetes" >}}).
