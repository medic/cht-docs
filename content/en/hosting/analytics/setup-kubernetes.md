This guide will walk you through setting up a deployment of CHT Sync with the CHT using Kubernetes. This path is recommended if you already have a Kubernetes cluster [hosting the CHT]({{< relref "hosting/4.x/production/kubernetes" >}}).

## Prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- A Kubernetes cluster: You can use a managed Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or you can set up a cluster using a tool like Minikube.
- kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool. You can install it using the [kubectl installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) instructions.
- Helm: The Kubernetes package manager. You can install it using the [helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- [cht-sync](https://github.com/medic/cht-sync) GitHub repository (can be cloned via `git clone https://github.com/medic/cht-sync`).

## Setup

In the `cht-sync` folder, copy the values in `deploy/cht_sync/values.yaml.template` file to a new file named `deploy/cht_sync/values.yaml`.

If you require a Postgres database to be set up in the cluster, you can use the `postgres.enabled` flag in the `values.yaml` file. If you already have a Postgres database outside the cluster, you can set the `postgres.enabled` flag to `false`. Also, if Postgres is outside the cluster, specify `host` and `port` in this section.

In either case, specify `user`, `password`, `db`, `schema`, and `table`.
  - `schema` can be used to separate CHT models from any other data that may already be in the database.
  - `table` is the name of the table that couch2pg will write couch documents to, and the source table for dbt models. It is recommended to leave this as `couchdb`.

```yaml
postgres:
  enabled: true
  user: "postgres"
  password: ""
  db: ""
  schema: "v1"
  table: "couchdb"
  host: "postgres" # if postgres is outside the cluster
  port: 5432 # if postgres is outside the cluster
```

Set CouchDB shared values in the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
couchdb:
  user: "your_couchdb_user"
  dbs: "medic"
  port: "443"
  secure: "true"
```

Configure the CouchDB instance to be replicated in the `values.yaml` file. For the host, use the CouchDB host URL used to publicly access the instance and for the password, use the password associated with the user set above.

```yaml
couchdbs:
  - host: "host1.cht-core.test"
    password: "password1"
```

If you have multiple CouchDB instances to replicate, you can add them to the `couchdbs` list.

```yaml
couchdbs:
  - host: "host1.cht-core.test"
    password: "password1"
  - host: "host2.cht-core.test"
    password: "password2"
```

If an instance has a different port, user or different CouchDB databases to be synced, you can specify it in the `couchdbs` list.

```yaml
  - host: "host1" # required for all couchdb instances
    password: "" # required for all couchdb instances
  - host: "host2.cht-core.test"
    password: "new_password"
    user: "separate_user"
    dbs: "medic medic_sentinel"
    port: "5984"
    secure: "false"
  - host: "host3.cht-core.test"
    password: "password3"
  ```

Set the [cht-pipeline branch URL]({{< relref "hosting/analytics/building-dbt-models#setup" >}}) in the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
cht_pipeline_branch_url: "https://github.com/medic/cht-pipeline.git#main"
```

(Optional) You can also configure a Metrics Exporter. If enabled, this will create a sql exporter that queries the database for couch2pg status, number of changes pending, and current sequence and exposes these metrics in Prometheus format at a service with name `metrics` at port 9399, for use with [CHT Watchdog]({{< relref "hosting/monitoring/setup" >}}) or any other monitoring service.

An HTTP ingress needs to be created to allow access from outside the cluster.

```yaml
metrics_exporter:
  enabled: true
```
## Deploy

Run the command below to deploy the cht-sync helm chart. The chart is at `deploy/cht_sync`; if `values.yaml` is in a different directory, specify the path.

```shell
cd deploy/cht_sync
helm install cht-sync . --values values.yaml
```

### Verify the deployment

Run the following command to get the status of the deployment.

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

Run the following command to get the logs of a pod.

```shell
kubectl logs -f cht-sync-<pod-id>
```
