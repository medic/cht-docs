{{< /callout >}}

> [!TIP]
> To get an overview on how these hosting solutions use `docker` and other key CHT concepts, be sure to read the [guide on a Local Setup](/building/local-setup). Note that while this is for CHT 4.x, the concepts apply to 3.x.

Before beginning any of these guides, be sure to meet all of the [CHT hosting requirements](/hosting/requirements) first.

To host a production instance of CHT, use either the [AWS](/hosting/3.x/ec2-setup-guide) or [Self](/hosting/3.x/self-hosting) hosting guides. To do app development, see our [App Developer](/hosting/3.x/app-developer) hosting guide.

To view 4.x hosting options, see the  [4.x hosting section](/hosting/4.x).
