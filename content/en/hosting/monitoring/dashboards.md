## Overview

This is the main dashboard for Watchdog.  It gives you high level details on your CHT instance.  Starting from the upper left and going from right to left you have:

1. Watchdog title and link to docs
2. CHT version information
3. Growth of 4 main databases:  This is good to check the health of your instance.  Are you seeing the same growth day over day?  Your users are probably good and successfully uploading documents.  Do you see a drop off of growth?  Maybe you deployed an app settings that changed or broke your deployment!
4. CHT Uptime: How long since the last reboot
5. Server time accurate: Is your server's time in sync with the correct time
6. Monthly active users: This is nice to compare with number of users in your database vs how many are active.  From this you can derive your engagement rate
7. User over replication limit: the number of users that are trying to replicate in excess of 10k docs
8. DB Conflicts rate: Rate of creation of doc conflicts which need to be resolved manually.
9. DB Fragmentation: The fragmentation of the db, lower is better, “1” is no fragmentation.
10. Outbound push backlog: Number of changes yet to be processed by Outbound Push. If this is persistently above 0 you likely have a configuration error in your outbound push
11. Sentinel backlog: Number of changes yet to be processed by Sentinel. If this is persistently above 0 you may have resource contention
12. CHT Sync Backlog: Number of CouchDB changes that have not yet been processed by CHT Sync. Requires setup of [SQL integration](/hosting/monitoring/setup/#additional-configuration).
13. Client Feedback/Error Rate: Number of feedback docs created usually indicative of client side errors.
14. Alerts: Alerts that need attention.  In this screenshot, you can see that the Client Feedback/Error Rate is too high and should be investigated.  See [alerts](/hosting/monitoring/setup/#alerts) for more information.

## Details

These 8 graphs show growth overtime of the respective sources.  This is really great to get a timestamp for changes in growth which can then be further investigated to see what else changed.

If CHWs are reporting that they're not seeing the data they're expecting, or if syncing is taking a long time, the "Sentinel Backlog" graph is great first place to check. In this case, there's small healthy spikes of backlog that resolved over a short amount of time.  If there were gaps in data that would represent an outage. If there were an ever increasing backlog, that would suggest resource contention (CPU).

## Replication

Replication Apdex: A score of 100 means all successful syncs proceeded by the server are fast enough to satisfy user's expectations (the sync completes in less than 3 mins). When the server takes longer than 3 minutes, users begin to be less satisfied and this ApDex number reduces. Users tolerate syncs which take between 3mins and 6mins. Users are frustrated by sync times over 6mins. See the [Apdex Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex) for more details.


| User State | Threshold                   |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| Satisfied  | <180s (3min)                |
| Tolerated  | >= 180 (3min) < 360s (6min) |
| Frustrated | >= 360s (6min)              |

## API Server

API server metrics (see [prometheus-api-metrics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prometheus-api-metrics)).
