---
There are various options for hosting CHT applications depending on the need and phase of your CHT application. Phases of the CHT application include development, testing, training and deployment. CHT Applications can be deployed on different platforms including: 
* Local installation on a desktop, laptop or server
* Self-Hosting/Data center set up
* Cloud Hosting using a cloud provider (e.g. AWS)

CHT installation can be done using various workflows:

* Docker Compose - This has been available for CHT < 4.x and can been implemented using a docker-compose file. 
* Kubernetes/k3s installation - CHT installation using k3s k8s distribution is the recommended method for CHT >= 4.x installations.
