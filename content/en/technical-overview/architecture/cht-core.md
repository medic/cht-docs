The CHT Core Framework is the primary component of the CHT. The server comes with authentication, role based authorization, data security, and a range of protected data access endpoints. Read more detail in [cht-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-core).

## Server

#### API

A NodeJS service that runs on the server and provides security and APIs for browsers and integrations. It also includes a custom implementation of filtered replication to allow it to support more concurrent users. See more at the [CHT Core API repo](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/api) on GitHub.

#### Sentinel

Another NodeJS service running on the server, `sentinel` performs actions called transitions every time a document in CouchDB is added or modified. Some examples are validations, generating scheduled messages, automatic responses, creating patients, and sending alerts. See more at the [CHT Core Sentinel repo](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/sentinel) on GitHub.

#### CouchDB

A free and open source NoSQL database used as the primary store for all app data and configuration. This can be multiple instances clustered together for additional scalability. CouchDB is really good at replication which is the process of sending the data to another database and back again, which makes it ideal for replicating data to the phone for offline access. See more at the [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) site.

#### Nouveau

Nouveau is a CouchDB service, added to the CHT in version `5.0.0`, leverages the [Lucene search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Lucene) to modernize how freetext searches are done.  Nouveau is faster at running these queries and more efficient at storing and creating the indexes. Offline users do not use this.  

#### NGINX

[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) provides SSL termination and routes requests to API.

#### HAProxy

[HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/) provides logging and reverse proxying for any request that makes it to CouchDB.

#### HealthCheck

A service that periodically verifies the health status of the CouchDb cluster. HAProxy uses this service for checking server status. 

#### CHT Upgrade Service

The CHT Upgrade Service is used within the CHT to update individual Docker containers when an upgrade is requested. Read more detail in the [cht-upgrade-service GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-upgrade-service/).

## Client

The CHT Core Framework provides two web applications: the [CHT Web App]({{% ref "#cht-web-application" %}}) for care teams and program staff, and [App Management]({{% ref "#app-management" %}}) for program administrators.

#### CHT Web Application

The CHT Web Application is used by Community Health Workers and provides a large variety of [features]({{< relref "building" >}}). View the source code in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/webapp).

##### Technology

The CHT Web Application is [reactive](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library), responsive, and a single page application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NgRx](https://ngrx.io) frameworks. Additionally, it uses the following technology:

The data is stored in PouchDB, which replicates changes back and forth in the background with the server CouchDB. |

##### Technology
App Management is a single page application built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) framework and implements [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) to manage a reactive state. Additionally, it uses the following technology:
