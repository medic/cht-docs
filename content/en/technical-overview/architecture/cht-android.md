  Native Android wrapper for CHT Web Application

The [cht-android](https://github.com/medic/cht-android) application is a thin Android wrapper to load the [CHT Core Framework web application]({{< relref "technical-overview/architecture/cht-core" >}}) in a Webview native container.

It consists of “flavored” configurations, where each “flavor” or “brand” is an app, which allows the application to be hardcoded to a specific CHT deployment and have a partner-specific logo and display name. The app also provides some deeper integration with other Android apps and native phone functions that are otherwise unavailable to webapps.
