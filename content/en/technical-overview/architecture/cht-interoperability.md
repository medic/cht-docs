[CHT Interoperability]({{< relref "/building/interoperability/" >}}) refers to the ability of different health information systems and applications to communicate with each other and exchange data seamlessly. With interoperability, patient information can be seen, exchanged, and used across different platforms. The information/data exchanged has to be understood across the different software for these systems to become interoperable. This is different from _integration_ which requires custom development to connect two specific systems together.
