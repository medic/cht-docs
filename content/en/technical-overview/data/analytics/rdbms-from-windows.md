Connecting to RDBMS, the PostgreSQL server, is pretty stratightforward in nix systems. In Windows there are a couple of things you need to do to get it up and running. 

## SSH Key Generation and Importing

1. Download Puttygen from [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/download)

2. Run Puttygen Go to Windows Start menu → All Programs → PuTTY→ PuTTYgen.

3. Create a new key pair for your computer.

4. Convert the key generated from ssh2 format to openssh. Puttygen [supports this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224066/how-to-convert-ssh-keypairs-generated-using-puttygen-windows-into-key-pairs-us/2224204#2224204).

    ```
    1. Open PuttyGen
    2. Click Load
    3. Load your private key
    4. Go to Conversions->Export OpenSSH and export your private key
    5. Copy your private key to ~/.ssh/id_dsa (or id_rsa).
    6. Create the RFC 4716 version of the public key using ssh-keygen
        ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa > ~/.ssh/id_dsa_com.pub
    6. Convert the RFC 4716 version of the public key to the OpenSSH format:
        ssh-keygen -i -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa_com.pub > ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
        
    ```

5. Import the file using PuTTYgen:

6. Save it as PuTTY Private Key File .ppk:

    {{< figure src="putty-save-key.png" link="putty-save-key.png" caption="putty-save-keys" >}}

7. Add the key (.ppk) to Pageant (PuTTY authentication agent):

    {{< figure src="putty-add-key.png" link="putty-add-key.png" caption="putty-add-key.png" >}}

8. Now you can connect to RDBMS using PuTTY:

    If you are connecting to rdbms in order to use a PostgreSQL client. You may not need to tunnel the connection. The client can do it for you.
