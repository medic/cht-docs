## Highlights

### Performance

The Contacts page loads much faster now. Using [apdex scores and testing on low spec devices](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/evaluating-app-performance-using-apdex-lets-dive-in-and-look-at-an-example/3475), we were able to identify slow areas and make improvements to both the [list view](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/performance-improvements-on-the-contacts-page-list-view/3501) and the [detail view](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/performance-improvements-on-the-contacts-page-detail-view/3486). 

#### Apdex Improvements

{{< figure src="../images/4.8.0-apdex-improvements.png" >}}

- [#9006](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9006): Improves performance of the list view by reducing the number of rows fetched each time
- [#9019](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9019): Improves performance of the detail view by reducing loops for tasks and reports


### Security

<<<<<<< HEAD
Two security issues with severity level of "high" and one of "low" were fixed in this release.  While Medic strives to have vulnerability free releases, we're always keeping an eye out for any issues that may have slipped through.  Thanks to these ongoing efforts, the three security issues fixed in this release are:

* Protect against a malicious 3rd party using the redirect after login feature to steal credentials
* Ensure users with basic access are not allowed to self-promote themselves to a user with more permissions
* Ensure users with basic access are not allowed to sensitive configuration files, like translations
=======
Three long standing security issues were fixed in this release, which were detected during routine penetration tests. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible to get the best possible cybersecurity protection.
