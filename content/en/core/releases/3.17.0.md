### UI/UX changes

- [#7653](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7653): Report's filter redesign 


## Highlights

### Update to Filters on the Reports Tab

Filtering on the Reports tab has been updated to more closely align with Android UX and [material design patterns](https://material.io/). This is the first of several incremental UI/UX changes that will improve app learnability by providing a familiar user interface that is consistent with other Android apps. To learn more about the other planned material design UI/UX changes, check out [this forum post](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/updates-to-the-cht-ui-ux/1998).

NOTE: The old version of the UI can be temporarily re-enabled by following the instructions [in the documentation]({{% ref "apps/features/reports#filters--search" %}}), but will be completely removed in a future release.
