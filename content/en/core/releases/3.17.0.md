Check the repository for the [latest known issues](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Affects%3A+3.17.0%22).

## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

#### Labels of action buttons are now available in small screens

A number of commonly used phones have a horizontal resolution of 720 with a default dp of 360. We have enabled the labels of action buttons for those small screens to make actions easier to understand.

- [#7721](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7721): Icon labels on action buttons are not showing at the default dp for commonly used mobile devices.

#### Report's filter redesign

The report's filter redesign is the first step of incremental UI/UX updates to make CHT Framework more scalable, intuitive and mobile-first. The old design is still available by enabling the [permission]({{< ref "apps/reference/app-settings/user-permissions" >}}) `can_view_old_reports_filter` to the users, however the old design is considered deprecated and will be _completely removed soon_ in a future release.

## Highlights

### Places created with bulk upload now have a primary contact

We have improved the [bulk upload]({{< ref "apps/guides/data/users-bulk-load" >}}) feature to automatically assign a primary contact to a newly created place.

- [#7724](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7724): Places created with bulk upload don't have a primary contact.

### Privacy policy is now public

Android app submission now requires a URL to the apps' privacy policy. To facilitate this process we have made the [privacy policy]({{< ref "apps/guides/privacy/privacy-policy" >}}) public in the login page.
