## Known issues

{{% alert title="" %}}
Due to a critical bug that prevented further upgrades from `4.7.0`, we have have removed `4.7.0` from our releases list, so that it will not be possible to upgrade to `4.7.0`. 
The bug has been fixed in [`4.7.1`]({{% ref "core/releases/4.7.1.md" %}}).     
If you have already installed or upgraded to `4.7.0`, please connect with us on the [forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/high-priority-issue-in-cht-core-4-7-0/3512) to get unblocked.     
We apologise for the inconvenience.

### Countdown widgets can now be made required in forms
