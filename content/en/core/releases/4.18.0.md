- [#9682](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9682): Add support for Right to Left languages

## Highlights

### Right to Left Language Support

{{< figure src="../images/4.18.0-rtl.png" >}}

Support for Arabic as a CHT language was [added in `4.16.0`]({{< ref "core/releases/4.16.0.md#arabic-as-cht-language" >}}). Now, the CHT can properly display content in a full RTL layout! This greatly improves the usability of the application for native RTL language speakers.

See [the documentation]( {{< ref "building/translations/localizing#2-rtl-support" >}} ) for more details.

Controlling the data accessible to ["offline" CHT users]({{< ref "building/concepts/users#offline-users" >}}) is essential. Often, the [`replication_depth` configuration]({{< ref "building/guides/performance/replication#depth" >}}) is used to limit how much of the contact hierarchy is visible to a user (and downloaded to their device) by preventing the replication of contacts/reports beyond a specified depth.

However, in some cases this configuration is not sufficient. For example, perhaps a CHW Supervisor needs to have access to the contact data for the CHWs they supervise (including the reports for those contacts), but should not have access to all the households/patients served by those CHWs. A typical hierarchy (as seen here) might have the CHW contact and the family household contacts both at the same depth level as children of the CHW Area. If the supervisor user is configured to have a replication depth of `1`, they will not have access to the CHW contact. If the replication depth is set to `2`, the supervisor will have access to all the household contacts.

In this case, the new [`replicate_primary_contacts` configuration]({{< ref "building/guides/performance/replication#replicate-primary-contacts" >}}) can be used to ensure the primary contacts of the places at the user's deepest replication depth are also replicated (even if those contacts are technically located deeper in the hierarchy than the configured depth limit). So, with a replication depth of `1` and `replicate_primary_contacts` set to `true`, the supervisor user will have access to the CHW contact, but not the household contacts.
