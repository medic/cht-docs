To build and iterate on new features at a pace that is faster than our regular release cycle, some features are released in a _Feature Release_. Feature Releases are based on the most recent release and only include improvements related to a feature being developed. These releases are tested to be production-ready so that new features can be studied with CHT partners in a live deployment, with the aim of getting the feature ready for wider use in an upcoming release.

## Release names

Each Feature Release will be a production-ready branch of the most recent release of the CHT. The release will have undergone applicable discretionary testing. You can easily identify a Feature Release by its version which follows the pattern of `LATEST_RELEASE-FR-FEATURE`. For example, if the latest release is `3.10.1` then the Feature Release for speedier upgrades would be `3.10.1-FR-speedier-upgrades`. When this feature is found to be of use, it would be automatically included in `3.11.0`, the next minor release after `3.10.1`.

## Upgrades

Once the feature is ready for widespread use it will be included in a regular CHT release. Projects using the feature version can be upgraded as soon as practical to get back on to a fully supported release.
