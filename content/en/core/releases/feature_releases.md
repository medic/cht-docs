The Product Team has two dedicated sub-teams (Allies and Care) who try to deliver much requested features at a pace that is faster than our release cycle. To this end, select partners working directly with Product Team can access what are called "Feature Releases". 

## Release names

Each Feature Releases will be a production ready branch of the most recent release of the CHT. The release will have undergone applicable discretionary testing. You can easily identify a Feature Release by its version which follows the pattern of `LATES_RELEASE-FR-FEATURE`. For example, if the latest release is `3.10.1` then the Feature Releases for speedier upgrades would be `3.10.1-FR-speedier-upgrades`. When this feature is found to be of use, it would be automatically included in `3.10.2`, the next minor release after `3.10.1`.

## Upgrades

Feature releases are always built on the latest version of the CHT.  They will always support an easy upgrade to the next minor or patch release of the CHT.
