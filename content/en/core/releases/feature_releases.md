To build and iterate on new features at a pace that is faster than our regular release cycle, some features are released in a _Feature Release_. Feature Releases are based on the most recent release and only include improvements related to a feature being developed. These releases are tested to be production-ready so that new features can be studied with CHT partners in a live deployment, with the aim of getting the feature ready for wider use in an upcoming release.

## Release names

A Feature Release can easily be identified by its version, which follows the pattern of `{BASE-RELEASE-NUMBER}-FR-{FEATURE-NAME}`. For example, if the latest release is `3.10.1` then the Feature Release for speedier upgrades would be `3.10.1-FR-speedier-upgrades`. When this feature is found to be successful and ready for wider distribution it will be included in the next release.

## Upgrades

Once the feature is ready for widespread use it will be included in a regular CHT release. Projects using the feature version can be upgraded as soon as practical to get back on to a fully supported release.
