The Product Team has two dedicated sub-teams (Allies and Care Teams) who try to deliver the most impactful features at a pace that is faster than our regular release cycle. To this end, select partners working directly with the Product Team can access what are called "Feature Releases". 

## Release names

Each Feature Release will be a production-ready branch of the most recent release of the CHT. The release will have undergone applicable discretionary testing. You can easily identify a Feature Release by its version which follows the pattern of `LATEST_RELEASE-FR-FEATURE`. For example, if the latest release is `3.10.1` then the Feature Release for speedier upgrades would be `3.10.1-FR-speedier-upgrades`. When this feature is found to be of use, it would be automatically included in `3.11.0`, the next minor release after `3.10.1`.

## Upgrades

Feature Releases are always built on the latest version of the CHT. Once the feature is ready, it will be included in a regular CHT release and the project will be upgraded as soon as practical to get back on to a fully supported release.
