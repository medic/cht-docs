## Highlights

### Change password on first login

System admin users create accounts for CHWs and then share the password with them. To enhance the security of these accounts, the CHT now supports a feature that prompts users to change their password upon their first login.

_NOTE: This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled for user roles based on the [`can_skip_password_change` permission]( {{< ref "building/reference/app-settings/user-permissions#system-defined-permissions" >}} )._

#### Details
- Only new users will be prompted to change their password on their first login when the permission is enabled.
- Subsequent logins won’t require a password change unless the admin manually updates the user’s password. In this case, the user will be prompted to change their password on their next login.
- If the user cannot change the password for any reason, they will be unable to access the app.
- If a user logs in for the first time, but closes the app before changing their password, they will be prompted again to change their password the next time they open the app.

See the [workflow documentation]( {{< ref "building/concepts/access#password-reset-on-first-login" >}} ) for more details.
