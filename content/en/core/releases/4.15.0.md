## Highlights

### Training Page

After deploying the training cards feature to introduce a new workflow to over 10,000 CHPs, we received feedback that users need a way to easily revisit their training content.
Care Teams is working on a new Training Materials page which will be found in the auxiliary menu of the CHT.

{{< figure src="../images/4.15.0-9598.png" >}}

It will display a list of training content that have been assigned to each user, with an indication to show which have been completed, that users can access repeatedly if necessary.
