## Known issues

Check the repository for the [latest known issues](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Affects%3A+4.3.0%22).

## Upgrade notes

Continuous downwards replication (the algorithm through which offline users download docs from the server) has been completely rewritten. This change required a high number of view updates, which implies that staging this upgrade and indexing views before upgrading will be a lengthy process - depending on the size of the database. Additionally, the server might need additional storage while this process is ongoing.

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

None.

## Highlights

### Adding phone numbers to patients when registering via SMS

Previously, it was only possible to assign a name and type of contact when creating a patient via SMS registration. As of 4.3.0, the registration transition supports saving a phone number field when creating a patient. [more details links to documentation]

### Rewritten in downwards replication

Downwards replication has been completely rewritten to improve performance, reduce complexity, remove the necessity of deleted documents tombstones and update the code to support eventual consistency, in order to allow for the CHT to work seamlessly with CouchDb high availability setups.

### New Prometheus API endpoint

A new API endpoint now allows exporting API request performance. The output allows for direct importing and visualization of statistical data into Prometheus. One possible use of this is in CHT-Watchdog. [more details about endpoint]
