## Highlights

### Training Cards

The *Training Cards* is a new feature designed to help health workers learn about changes to CHT apps remotely, directly in their app. Training content might include information about a newly deployed feature, changes to a [care guide]({{< relref "apps/concepts/care-guides" >}}), or simply a reminder about an underused feature or workflow. You can read more about it in the [Training Cards documentation]({{< relref "apps/features/training" >}}).
