The Community Health Toolkit includes 2 apps that are currently supported: the **[CHT Android](https://github.com/medic/cht-android)** and the **[CHT Gateway](https://github.com/medic/cht-gateway)**. The following guides will help you setup a development environment in you local computer to improve, release, and brand the apps (branding only applies to CHT Android).

**[Medic Collect](https://github.com/medic/medic-collect)** is currently in maintenance mode, although some of the guides here may apply if you need to work with it.
