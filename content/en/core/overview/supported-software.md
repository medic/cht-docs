Medic Mobile supports minor versions of the Core Framework for three months after the next minor version is made available, and the latest minor of a major version for twelve months after the next major version is made available.

Once a version is no longer supported it will not receive any further releases and upgrading may be required before Medic Mobile can investigate any issues.
