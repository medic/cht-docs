Medic supports minor versions of the CHT Core Framework for three months after the next minor version is made available, and the latest minor of a major version for twelve months after the next major version is made available.

Once a version is no longer supported it will not receive any further patch releases and upgrading to a supported version will be required to resolve any issues you have.
