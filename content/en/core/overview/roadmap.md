The CHT is actively developed by [Medic](https://medic.org), a non-profit organization that serves as the technical steward, alongside many [partners in the CHT Community]( {{% ref "why-the-cht#the-cht-community" %}}).
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Improvements for the CHT are raised and discussed with the community in the [Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/23), and tracked in the [CHT Roadmap](https://roadmap.communityhealthtoolkit.org). The roadmap is organized around _**Product initiatives**_; specific improvement areas that align with medium and long-term vision for the CHT. These initiatives are organized by the ones that are being worked on _**Now**_, those that are likely _**Next**_, and those that might be _**Later**_. 

### Views
The views represent initiatives being tackled by multidisciplinary working groups that focus on different key users: **Care Teams** for patients, caregivers, CHWs, supervisors; **Allies** for those that support health systems, like program administrators and app builders; and **Infrastructure** for CHT hosting service providers and core developers.

### Communication
Initiatives are communicated quarterly to the CHT Community on the [CHT Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/roadmaps/25) and discussed monthly on the CHT Roundup calls. Please reach out via the [Forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/c/product/23) to discuss your ideas and thoughts on product improvements.
