## Server

### CHT Core Framework

The cht-core product is the primary component of the CHT. The server comes with authentication, role based authorization, data security, and a range of protected data access endpoints. Read more detail in [cht-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-core).

#### API

A NodeJS service which runs on the server and provides security and APIs for browsers and integrations. It also includes a custom implementation of filtered replication to allow it to support more concurrent users. See more at the [CHT Core API repo](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/api) on Github.

#### Sentinel

Another NodeJS service running on the server, sentinel performs actions called transitions every time a document in CouchDB is added or modified. Some examples are validations, generating scheduled messages, automatic responses, creating patients, and sending alerts. See more at the [CHT Core Sentinel repo](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/sentinel) on Github. 

#### CouchDB

A free and open source NoSQL database used as the primary store for all app data and configuration. This can be multiple instances clustered together for additional scalability. CouchDB is really good at replication which is the process of sending the data to another database and back again, which makes it ideal for replicating data to the phone for offline access. See more at the [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) site.

#### NGINX

[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) provides SSL termination and routes requests to API.

#### HAProxy

[HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/) provides audit logging for any request that makes it to CouchDB so any data access or modification can be validated at a later date.

### CHT Upgrade Service

The CHT Upgrade Service is used within the CHT to update individual Docker containers when an upgrade is requested. Read more detail in the [cht-upgrade-service GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-upgrade-service/).

### CHT Sync

A suite of tools for extracting and normalizing data from the Core Framework's CouchDB, and rendering the data in analytics dashboards to visualize key data for a CHT deployment. Read more detail on the [CHT Sync overview page]({{< relref "core/overview/cht-sync" >}}) and the [cht-sync GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-sync).

### CHT Watchdog

Monitoring and alerting for the CHT Core Framework to ensure CHWs are able to deliver care without interruption caused by server downtime.  Read more detail on the [CHT Watchdog overview page]({{< relref "core/overview/watchdog" >}}) and the [CHT Watchdog GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-watchdog).

## Client

### CHT Core Framework

The CHT Core Framework provides two web applications: the [CHT Web App]({{% ref "#cht-web-application" %}}) for care teams and program staff, and [App Management]({{% ref "#app-management" %}}) for program administrators.

#### CHT Web Application

The CHT Web Application is used by Community Health Workers and provides a large variety of [features](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/features/). View the source code in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/webapp).

##### Technology

The CHT Web Application is [reactive](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library), responsive and a single page application built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [NgRx](https://ngrx.io) frameworks. Additionally, it uses the following technology:

### cht-android

CHT Web Application works in the browser or wrapped in the [CHT Android](https://github.com/medic/cht-android) app which allows for project branding, sets the project URL, and hides browser elements like the URL bar.

## Other applications

### cht-gateway

### medic-collect

[Medic Collect](https://github.com/medic/medic-collect) is an android app based on [Open Data Kit](https://opendatakit.org) to render xforms on the phone and send reports in to cht-gateway over SMS or directly to api over mobile data.

### cht-conf

[cht-conf](https://github.com/medic/cht-conf) is a command line utility for uploading configuration and bulk importing of records.
