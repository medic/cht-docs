## CHT training process

In the implementation of CHT supported community health programs, health care workers such as CHWs, CHW supervisors and facility based health care providers need training to help equip them with the required knowledge and skills to effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities. For most deployments, program leads/officials and ministries of health officials may also need training for them to perform their roles, oversight and supervise the community health programs. 

During the training, end users are trained in the following commons areas to help modify their skills, attitude and behaviour:
* Thematic training: this training focuses on the health program areas of interest, this will vary from one program to another depending on the specific health areas users are expected to support. For example, for an MNCH program; users will be trained in ANC, PNC and immunization.
* CHT tool training: this involves training users on how they can use different CHT tools (SMS, mobile apps and webapp) to guide them to deliver health care services. 
* Skills development: in this area, users are trained on interpersonal communication, listening skills, capacity building skills and how they can promote healthy behaviour change.
* Behavioural: this area enables the users to build relations in the community and learn how they can work within diverse communities.  

Proper training of health care workers leads to increased job satisfaction and it ensures that the health care workers are able to provide high quality care.

This guide describes some of the considerations and steps for planning and conducting end user training. This guide is based on the learnings from many collaborative trainings that have been conducted over the course of several years, some of the training resources have been co-created with various implementing partners and ministries of health. This guide can help partners to learn about how they can plan and conduct training.

The CHT training process comprises a series of steps that need to be followed systematically to ensure an efficient training programme, these are):
* Training needs assessment - this is the first step prior to conducting the training to help understand the users needs, bahaviour, roles and how they perform their responsibilities. At this stage, information on the literacy and numerical skills of end users, demographics (age, gender, language of instruction), potential program champions is collected, this information helps to inform the training approach, duration and methods of training. Different approaches can be used to collect the needs assessment information, this includes: observations, interviews and focused group discussions and surveys. 
* Defining the training objectives - In this step, the training outcomes are defined, these are things end users should be able to do as a result of the training.  
* Developing a training plan/checklist - A training checklist is created, the checklist lists the tasks, activities and resources needed to train the end users
* Creating the training materials and resources - At this stage the training materials and resources are developed. 
* Conduct the training - Different training approaches can be adopted. This includes direct training of end users, training of trainers (ToT) model which involves preparing program champions to be able to cascade the training, use of CHT training cards which users are able to access training resources in-app, remote online training and self learning through a learning management system.   
* Evaluate the training - In this stage, the training outcomes are assessed to determine if the training has achieved the expected outcomes. The learning objectives will help to determine the evaluation process that would be most appropriate.  
* Follow up, refresher training and evaluation.



##  Pre training
Before training is done, a training preparation checklist is prepared to ensure all items listed below are catered to.

#### Tech preparation
* Create WebApp Instance (training & production instances)
* User accounts created (CHVs, CHAs, Sub County and County team logins)
* Configuration of UAT changes in forms 
* Preparation of a ToT training deck

#### Logistics

* Identify appropriate participants and confirm the total number of participants
* Confirm and organize training venue
* Obtain phones for the training  with [minimum specs requirements]({{< relref "apps/concepts/access" >}})
* Ensure phones are fully charged prior to training
* Guide users on how to obtain and register SIM cards
* Load airtime into phones
* Install mobile application
* Pack phones, chargers and any other applicable hardware to take to the training venue
* Prepare the inventory with CHP names, SIM number and phone IMEI number
* Prepare the mobile and SIM Handover form with a documented mobile and SIM Management guideline handout
* Confirm availability of electricity, mobile network and internet at the training venue
* Invite the partner to lead the training
* Organize and process payment forms, if applicable, for:
    * Trainer and co-trainer allowance
    * Health facility training participation allowance
    * Travel allowance for applicable health facility staff and/or participants
    * Venue and other expenses
 
#### Training materials

* Prepare training materials- add template.
* Prepare training agenda with daily training plan (sample), trainer responsibilities and activities
* Prepare screenshots/posters of training materials as backup
* Finalize take-home user guide
* Finalize on the trainer and co-trainer resources.
* Translate training materials and arrange for a translator, if appropriate/required
* Organize supplies and stationery (markers, pens, notebooks, meta cards, tape, newsprint, index cards, handouts, take-home guides, projector and other required training equipment)

* Print training materials such as posters as backup incase there is no electricity, take-home guides, pre and post test evaluation
    * Training materials/posters (as a backup in case there is no electricity)
    * Take-home guides
    * Evaluations (pre and post tests)
    * Certificates (have the certificates signed by the COP) if necessary
* Pretest - add example provided

#### Partner checklist
* Agree/commit to deadline for final design changes (if required)
* Outline and determine action plans for common issues that arise during deployment such as covering airtime costs and hardware replacement policy
* Complete training on health service delivery component e.g ANC, PNC
* Assign training/project contact person to lead post-training follow up such as lost hardware, no airtime, etc.

## Training

### Conducting a training
Training should be approached in a cohesive and integrated manner, starting with the initial training of the end users, followed by regular refresher training, with continuous support, supervision and mentorship. Training is usually carried out collaboratively by the implementing partners, ministry of health officials and project implementers. 

Different training approaches can be used to train end users. Several factors determine the training approach that is to be used, this includes the number of trainees and facilitators, user demographics, learning objectives, training environment and the available resources. The training approaches include: the training of trainers (ToT) model, direct end-user training and remote training. The ToT model is used to train a large pool of end users. For this model, a cadre of end users are trained as ToTs and after the training they are expected to cascade, reinforce and support the training of other end users. Direct training involves a trainer conducting an in-person training of end users while for the remote training, end users are trained online or they can access the training resources on their devices.

### Training delivery methods
There are a number of training methods that can be used to train end users. Blended training, participatory and interactive techniques can be used to make the training effective. The table below has a list of some of the delivery methods (the list is not exhaustive).

| Method    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|Role play |Learners act out the different roles they are assigned. Following the skit, there are discussions and conclusions related to the topic. |
|Presentations|In this learning, a facilitator delivers content through oral, video and visual aids. This mode of training provides clarification to the participants.|
|Demonstrations|A skill is demonstrated with a goal of facilitating understanding, eliciting comments and explanations.|
|Pair work|Participants are able to work in pairs so that participants with low confidence are able to learn from other participants.|
|Case studies|In this mode of learning, a facilitator presents facts about a theoretical case or scenario and learners are asked to intervene and make suggestions, followed by a conclusion about the case.|
|Interactive simulations|This method provides an opportunity for learners to practise, for example -participants can practise how they can register new households on CHT.|
|Teachbacks|Trainees pick a topic or a skill they have learned in one of the sessions and teach it to their peers|
|Question and answer|The learners are provided with a set of questions which they are expected to answer so as to establish their prior level of understanding of a certain topic|
|Hands-on practice|Learners get to experience and practise what they have learned, for example a learner will get the experience of navigating a digital app.|
|Individual work and assessments|Participants work individually to answer written or oral questions about a topic that has already been covered in the training|
|Flip charts|These are wall and board hangings that can serve as visual aids to reinforce learning.|
|Group assessments|Learners work together to answer questions or complete assigned tasks aimed at assessing knowledge of topics already covered in the training.|
