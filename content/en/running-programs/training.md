## CHT training process

In the implementation of CHT supported community health programs, health care workers such as CHWs, CHW supervisors and facility based health care providers need training to help equip them with the required knowledge and skills to effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities. For most deployments, program leads/officials and ministries of health officials may also need training for them to perform their roles, oversight and supervise the community health programs. 

During the training, end users are trained in the following commons areas to help modify their skills, altitude and behaviour:
* Thematic training: this training focuses on the health program areas of interest, this will vary from one program to another depending on the specific health areas users are expected to support. For example, for an MNCH program; users will be trained in ANC, PNC and immunization.
* CHT tool training: this involves training users on how they can use different CHT tools (SMS, mobile apps and webapp) to guide them to deliver health care services 
* Skills development: in this area, users are trained on interpersonal communication, listening skills, capacity building skills and how they can promote healthy behaviour change.
* Behavioural: this area enables the users to build relations in the community and learn how they can work within diverse communities.  

Proper training of health care workers leads to increased job satisfaction and it ensures that the health care workers are able to provide high quality care.

This guide describes some of the considerations and steps for planning and conducting end user training. This guide is based on the learnings from many collaborative trainings that have been conducted over the course of several years, some of the training resources have been co-created with various implementing partners and ministries of health. This guide can help partners to learn about how they can plan and conduct training.

The CHT training process comprises a series of steps that need to be followed systematically to ensure an efficient training programme, these are):
* Training needs assessment - this is the first step prior to conducting the training to help understand the users needs, bahaviour, roles and how they perform their responsibilities. At this stage, information on the literacy and numerical skills of end users, demographics (age, gender, language of instruction), potential program champions is collected, this information helps to inform the training approach, duration and methods of training. Different approaches can be used to collect the needs assessment information, this includes: observations, interviews and focused group discussions and surveys. 
* Defining the training objectives - In this step, the training outcomes are defined, these are things end users should be able to do as a result of the training.  
* Developing a training plan/checklist - A training checklist is created, the checklist lists the tasks, activities and resources needed to train the end users
* Creating the training materials and resources - At this stage the training materials and resources are developed. 
* Conduct the training - Different training approaches can be adopted. This includes direct training of end users, training of trainers (TOT model) which involves preparing program champions to be able to cascade the training, use of CHT training cards (learners are able to access training resources in-app), remote online training and self learning through the learning management system (academy).   
* Evaluate the training - In this stage, the training outcomes are assessed to determine if the training has achieved the expected outcomes. The learning objectives will help to determine the evaluation process that would be most appropriate.  
* Follow up, refresher training and evaluation



## Training Preparation Checklist

    * Trainer and co-trainer allowance
    * Health facility training participation allowance
    * Travel allowance for applicable health facility staff and/or participants
    * Venue and other expenses
 
#### Training materials

* Prepare training materials- add template.
* Prepare training agenda with daily training plan (sample), trainer responsibilities and activities
* Prepare screenshots/posters of training materials as backup
* Finalize take-home user guide
* Finalize on the trainer and co-trainer resources.
* Translate training materials and arrange for a translator, if appropriate/required
* Organize supplies and stationery (markers, pens, notebooks, meta cards, tape, newsprint, index cards, handouts, take-home guides, projector and other required training equipment)

* Print training materials such as posters as backup incase there is no electricity, take-home guides, pre and post test evaluation
    * Training materials/posters (as a backup in case there is no electricity)
    * Take-home guides
    * Evaluations (pre and post tests)
    * Certificates (have the certificates signed by the COP) if necessary
* Pretest

#### Partner checklist
* Agree/commit to deadline for final design changes (if required)
* Outline and determine action plans for common issues that arise during deployment such as covering airtime costs and hardware replacement policy
* Complete training on health service delivery component e.g ANC, PNC
* Assign training/project contact person to lead on post-training follow up such as lost hardware, no airtime, etc.

#### Training - What is to be added here?


#### Post training
* Post training test
* Evaluate Deployment Summary
* Confirm all trained users are added to the production instance
* Prepare for Go live 
* Installation of the live application
* Sensitization on privacy and security best practices.
* Plan for user feedback sessions
* Follow up on monthly engagement reports
* Schedule refresher trainings
