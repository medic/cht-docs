There are various ways of running Community Health Toolkit programs and many considerations are made to determine the type of program to run. Below are the different partnership approaches used to deploy CHT tools.

## Types of CHT programs
**Accompanied programs**

Medic has accompanied various ministries of health and digital health implementers through their digital journey in designing, building, making enhancements including integrations and deploying CHT based tools for their unique health system needs. 

**Technical organizations led programs**

As a technical steward of the CHT, Medic has also established a network of technical organizations which have been onboarded on CHT to enable them to build and support community health information systems independently.

**Research initiatives, innovations and studies**

Through the human centered design approach, Medic partners with research institutions and academia to design, test, refine and deploy digital health innovations and carry out research studies. These programs are aimed at testing concepts or interventions before large scale implementation. They run for a limited time and often have pre-determined objectives to establish facts. 

**Community led programs**

The CHT has a robust community that works together to identify goals that are used to run CHT programs. Community led programs emphasize on the importance of intentional collaboration with local solutions at the center.

## Considerations for Digital Health programs
Below are the considerations made when running a digital health program:
- Scope - goals, deadlines, and program deliverables
- Technical requirements - devices, servers and storage requirements
- Ethics and regulations - governance, privacy and security which vary from country to country
- Landscape - general understanding of the region that the program will run in
- Healthcare ecosystem - standards, implementing partners, facilities and governing bodies
- Human resource requirements - skills to build and sustain the program

## CHT Lifecycle
CHT programs follow a process from beginning to end in order to deliver a complete functional solution. This process is referred to as the CHT Lifecycle. Although the process my differ from program to program, the process below is what has been used for most of our deployed programs. It is an iterative process that involves feedback collection and improvement.
{{< figure src="cht_lifecycle.png" link="cht_lifecycle.png" class="center col-8 col-lg-8" >}}
- Initiation - introductions and initial conversation with the implementing partner. At this stage, the implementing partner defines the problem they would like to solve and the kind of program they would like to run. They also understand the various capabilities and features of the CHT.
- Planning - includes coming up with detailed workplans, schedules, budget forecasting and baseline data collection.
- Design - design plan sharing and reviewing, design field trips, definition of user personas, preperation of design workflows and program hierarchy.
- Building - refers to development of forms, tasks, targets, debugging and other aspects of CHT applications.
- Hosting - includes different hosting options, data migration, configuration and optimization of CHT applications in various environments.
- Implementation - refers to the process of putting CHT applications into action. It includes training plan development, logistics planning, expenditure forecasting and tracking, tech support training, application installation and end user training.
- Support - refers to activities done after deployment and implementation. It includes managing updates, building dashboards, monitoring and evaluation, impact measurement and user experience feedback.
- Evaluation - includes budget tracking, discussions on scaling, report writing on impact and challenges experienced. Feedback is collected before the next development cycle begins.

## Program personas
Various people interact with CHT programs at various stages. The list below may not be exhaustive and different personas can have overlapping roles.
- Program heads - digital health leads as they are also referred to, comprise of people who oversee the support and implementation of digital health technology strategies in communities. They interact with the CHT program at the initiation stage.
- Program administrators - they are involved in planning, directing and coordinating resources, meetings, payment, key milestones and communicating the workplan and schedule. Although these personas oversee the entire program, they interact with the CHT program closely at the planning, implementation and evaluation stages. They include program managers, finance officers and project managers.
- Designers - they include service designers, UX/UI designers, product designers and graphic designers. Designers interact with CHT programs at different stages including the design stage where service designers carry out field visits to interact with prospective end users and come up with design specification forms that inform what is required in application and contact forms. Product and UI/UX designers are involved in the design phase and evaluation stages where they provide feedback to help optimize user interaction.
- Developers - they include app developers, core developers and software developers who are invloved in the building stage. App developers build application forms, contact forms, application settings among other configurations. Core devlopers build the [CHT Core framework]({{< ref "core" >}}) that forms the basis of CHT applications.
- System administrators - they include database administators, security engineers,site reliability engineers, devOps engineers and network managers. They are responsible for the upkeep, uptime and configuration of computers, servers, databases, pipelines and infrastructure of CHT applications. They interact with CHT programs at the planning, hosting and support stages.
- Technical support officials - they include ICT officers and monitoring & evaluation officers. ICT officers are responsible for installation and technical assistance provision for issues experienced by end users post deployment. Monitoring & evaluation officers are responsible for monitoring project indicators, target evaluation, dashboard monitoring and program data collection for analysis and reporting. They interact with CHT programs at the support stage.
- Researchers - they include data scientists, UX researchers and research scientists. They are invloved in data collection, analysis and hypothesis testing. They interact with CHT programs at the evaluation stage.

## Running successful community health programs
Running a successful digital health program depends on various factors. Here are a couple of things we champion for:

**Community health workers**

Community health workers improve health outcomes in any given society and it's important that they are provided good working conditions and the right tools to excel at what they do. To enable this, the items listed below are important. You can find out more on the [eight proCHW best practices](https://joinchic.org/what-we-do/).

- Continuous training for skill growth
- Supervision to ensure performance management
- Compensation for economic growth and sustainability
- Integration into the global health workforce

**Technical resources optimization**

CHT programs are powered by various tools and commodities that are integral.

- Privacy and protection of user data
- Monitoring and evalution
- Data backups
- Redundancy
- Regular CHT upgrades
- Regular device maintenance (Android app and security updates)
- Regular device hardware replacement


**Design**

- Human-centered design
- Consistent user feedback
- Material design guidelines
