There are various ways of running Community Health Toolkit implementations and many considerations are made to determine the type of implementation to run. Below are the different approaches used to deploy CHT tools.

## Types of CHT implementations approaches
**Accompaniment approach**

Medic and other digital health implementers accompanies various ministries of health through their digital journey in designing, building, integrating and deploying CHT based tools for their unique health system needs. 

**Community led implementations**

The CHT has a robust community of practice that works together to support and maintain CHT implementations and contribute to the CHT. Community led implementations emphasize on the importance of collaboration, local ownership and sustainability.
As a technical steward of the CHT, Medic has also established a network of local and regional technical organizations that have been onboarded on CHT to enable them to build and support CHT powered applications independently.

**Research initiatives, innovations and studies**

Through human centered design, research institutions and academia  design, test, refine and deploy digital health innovations and carry out research studies. These implementations are aimed at testing concepts or interventions before large scale implementation. They run for a limited time and often have pre-determined objectives to establish facts. 

## Considerations for digital health implementations
Below are the considerations made when running a digital health implementation:
- Scope - goals, deadlines, and implementation deliverables
- Technical requirements - devices, servers and storage requirements
- Context - general understanding of the region, policies, legal requirements, mobile connectivity and community health setup
- Human resource requirements - skills to build and sustain the implementation

## CHT Lifecycle
CHT implementations follow a process from beginning to end in order to deliver a complete functional solution. This process is referred to as the CHT Lifecycle. Although the process may differ from implementation to implementation, the process below is what has been used for most deployed implementations. It is an agile and iterative process that involves feedback collection and improvement.
{{< figure src="cht_lifecycle.png" link="cht_lifecycle.png" class="center col-8 col-lg-8" >}}
- Initiation - at this stage, the implementing partner defines the scope of the implementation they would like to run. They also understand the various capabilities and features of the CHT.
- Planning - includes coming up with detailed workplans, schedules, budget estimation, baseline data collection, user estimation and resource planning.
- Design - design plan sharing and reviewing, design field trips, definition of user personas, preperation of design workflows and implementation hierarchy.
- Building - refers to the app development process where workflows are configured, tested and improved.
- Hosting - includes different hosting options, data migration, configuration and optimization of CHT applications in various environments.
- Implementation - refers to the process of training end users and them using the CHT application to support the delivery of health care services. It includes training plan development, logistics planning, expenditure estimation and tracking, tech support training and application installation.
- Support - this is the support provided to end users to address any technical issues and ensure the usability of the tools.
- Evaluation - includes budget tracking, discussions on scaling, report writing and user feedback activities to help improve user experience and impact before the next development cycle begins.

## Implementation personas
Various people interact with CHT implementations at various stages. The list below may not be exhaustive and different personas can have overlapping roles.
- Program administrators - they are also referred to as program heads or digital health leads. They are involved in planning, directing and coordinating resources, meetings, payment, key milestones and communicating the workplan and schedule. Although these personas oversee the entire implementation, they interact with the CHT implementation closely at the planning, implementation and evaluation stages. They include implementation managers, finance officers and project managers.
- Designers - they include service designers, user experience/user interface designers, product designers and graphic designers. Designers interact with CHT implementations at different stages including the design stage where service designers carry out field visits to interact with prospective end users and come up with design specification forms that inform what is required for app development. Product and UI/UX designers are involved in the design phase and evaluation stages where they provide feedback to help optimize user interaction.
- Developers - they include app developers, core developers and software developers who are invloved in the building stage. App developers build application forms, contact forms, application settings among other configurations. Core devlopers build the [CHT Core framework]({{< ref "core" >}}) that forms the basis of CHT applications.
- System administrators - they include database administators, security engineers,site reliability engineers, devOps engineers and network managers. They are responsible for the upkeep, uptime and configuration of computers, servers, databases, pipelines and infrastructure of CHT applications. They interact with CHT implementations at the planning, hosting and support stages.
- Technical support team - they include ICT officers and monitoring & evaluation officers. ICT officers are responsible for installation and technical assistance provision for issues experienced by end users post deployment. Monitoring & evaluation officers are responsible for monitoring project indicators, target evaluation, dashboard monitoring and implementation data collection for analysis and reporting. They interact with CHT implementations at the support stage.
- Researchers - they include data scientists, UX researchers and research scientists. They are invloved in data collection, analysis and hypothesis testing.

Incase the implementing partner doesn't have the expertise listed above, the CHT has a robust network of technical partners who have built CHT applications and have a deep understanding of how CHT implementations work.
## Running successful community health implementations
Running a successful digital health implementation depends on various factors. Here are a couple of things to champion for:

**Community health workers**

Community health workers improve health outcomes in any given society and it's important that they are provided good working conditions and the right tools to excel at what they do. To enable this, the items listed below are important. You can find out more on the [eight proCHW best practices](https://joinchic.org/what-we-do/).

- Continuous training for skill growth
- Supervision to ensure performance management
- Compensation for economic growth and sustainability
- Integration into the global health workforce
- Equipping with required tools (first aid box, MUAC tape, thermometer, etc.)

**Technical resources optimization**

CHT implementations are powered by various tools and commodities that are integral.

- Privacy and protection of user data
- Monitoring and evalution
- Data backups
- Redundancy
- Regular CHT upgrades
- Regular device maintenance (Android app and security updates)
- Regular device hardware replacement


**Design**

- Human-centered design
- Consistent user feedback
- Material design guidelines
