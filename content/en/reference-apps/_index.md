  Templates for structuring and organizing community health workflows
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

The Community Health Toolkit’s examples and reference apps provide templates for structuring and organizing a community health workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework. They include a foundation for forms, data fields, and analytics, and can be deployed as-is or easily customized by a developer for your unique context.
