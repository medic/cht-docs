  Compilation of guidelines used at Medic for designing, building & maintaining tools
---

The Product team works with Medic teammates, partners, and health workers to design, build, and maintain Medic tools. We work with our partners along the entire software development life-cycle to understand problems, capture requirements, design and build modular software systems, and document everything along the way.

This Handbook contains best practices and guidelines we've put together *so far* in the Product team at Medic.

**Also, improvements and ideas for this doc site are [always welcome]({{% ref "contribute/docs" %}})!**
