## Highlights

### Support replacing a CHW user without any connectivity

Offline users can now be replaced on a device so that a new user can use that device without needing to immediately sync with the server. You can read more about it in [the transitions configuration docs]({{< ref "building/reference/app-settings/transitions#create_user_for_contacts" >}}).
