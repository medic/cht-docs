## Highlights

### Allow contact searches in forms to be filtered by descendants of the current contact

A [contact selector]({{< relref "building/forms/configuring/form-inputs#contact-selector" >}}) can be used in forms to allow users to select a contact by searching. In addition to limiting the searchable contacts by their type, now you can configure the search field to only show contacts which are descendants of the current contact. This is useful when you only want to allow a user to select specific contacts (such as members of the current household). Learn how to configure this functionality in [the documentation]({{< relref "building/forms/configuring/form-inputs#loading-descendants-of-the-current-contact" >}}).

- [#8074](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/8074): Support filtering contact search in forms by descendants of the current contact

### Official configuration for deploying the CHT to Kubernetes

Configuration files and scripts are now available for deploying the CHT to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes Helm charts, Kubernetes templates, and shell scripts for managing a deployment. See the [README documentation](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/scripts/deploy/README.md) for more information.

- [#8695](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/8695): Provide kubernetes configuration and helm charts for production deployments

### Form performance improvements

Performance of CHT forms has been significantly improved! Particularly, large forms with complex calculations will load considerably faster and be more responsive. In [our tests](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/feature-testing-enketo-7-uplift-for-cht-core/3196/2?u=mrjones), we observed ~60% improvement in load times for a large form when compared with `3.15.0` (and a ~33% improvement over `4.5.0`). Other partners have also [observed](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/benchmark-4-6-vs-4-5/3418) similar results!
