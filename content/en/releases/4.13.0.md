## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

- [#8119](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/8119): Show confirmation message in training cards when navigating to another page


## Highlights

### Targets accuracy improvements

The calculation and aggregation of targets and recalculation of tasks have been refactored from only being triggered when visiting certain pages to being calculated automatically when the state changes or documents are updated. Previously, target calculations could be incomplete or inaccurate when users switched devices or didn't regularly open certain pages to trigger the calculation. This change ensures that all user activities are properly counted in their respective monthly periods.

### Training card confirmation modal

A confirmation message is now shown when a user quits the training cards before the training is finished.
