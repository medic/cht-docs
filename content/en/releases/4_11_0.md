## Highlights

### The CHT-Datasource API now supports querying persons

The CHT datasource API has been expanded to allow querying places and persons by contact type.

##### Details
See more details in the [API docs]({{< relref "building/reference/api#get-apiv1person" >}}).

### Phone numbers are not required to be checked for duplicates
Phone number fields can now be used without automatically checking for duplicates. This can be useful for workflows where users may share a phone or for any workflow where having duplicate phones is possible, and it's undesirable to check for duplicates.

Duplicate checking is still available if desired.

##### Details
- Previously, the phone widget was configured in an xlsxform field by setting `type: tel`. By default, the phone widget both validates the phone number value and checks for existing contacts that have the same number.
- With these new changes, the existing (now deprecated) functionality stays the same, but going forward, phone number fields should be configured in an xlsxform by setting `type: string` with `appearance: number tel`.
- Fields with this new configuration will always validate the phone number value, but by default they will not check for existing contacts with the same number.
- To enforce a unique phone number with the new style of field, you should add a new column with `instance::cht:unique_tel: true`.

### The logged in users contact summary contains more target documents

The contact-summary function now receives the last three target documents of the contact, available through the CHT API.
Additionally, the logged in user's target documents are passed to the contact-summary function when generating the contact summary of one of the logged in user's facilities.
More details [in the contact page docs]( https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/reference/contact-page/#cht-api)
