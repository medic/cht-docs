### UI/UX changes

This release adds support for assigning multiple places to users. Users who are configured to have multiple places will see some subtle UI changes as described in the [Highlights](#highlights) section. For a video walkthrough of the changes, check out the [June 2024 CHT Round-up call](https://youtu.be/hrhdrzP41gE?si=_7wglk7Nm7CCSFbY&t=606) and [this forum post](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/support-for-supervisors-who-need-to-manage-multiple-areas/3497/2?u=michael).


## Highlights

### Allow multiple places to be assigned to users
To better support Supervisors who manage CHWs across multiple areas, it is now possible to assign more than one “Place” (ie Community Health Unit, Health Center, etc…) to a user. To enable this feature, simply assign the `can_have_multiple_places` permission to the relevant user role(s) and add the desired “Place(s)” to the user.

#### Setup
If the User’s Role has the appropriate permission, it will be possible to assign multiple Places. _Note: Selected Places must be at the same level in the hierarchy._

_IMPORTANT: When removing a Place that was previously assigned to a user, app storage needs to be cleared on the physical device. When adding a Place to an existing user, that user will sync the new Place and associated data automatically the next time they sync._

#### User Experience
Users who are assigned multiple Places will see a few changes in the CHT’s User Interface. These changes are summarized below, and are discussed in detail [in this forum post](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/support-for-supervisors-who-need-to-manage-multiple-areas/3497).

**Contacts Page:** The List View will show all assigned Places (ie CHUs) but will not show the list of child places (ie CHW Areas).

**Contact Detail:** The list of child places (ie CHW Areas) can be viewed on this page.

**Messages, Tasks, and Reports Pages:** Data for all assigned Places will show up together in the List View. An additional level of lineage has been added to the Breadcrumbs to clarify which Place each item (Message, Task, or Report) is associated to.

**Targets:** Personal Targets will look the same. Aggregate Targets will not be shown for users with multiple assigned places, even if the user has the permission. Support for Aggregate Targets for users associated to multiple places will potentially be supported in a later release.

### Signature widget
For some time now [there has been interest](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/signature-drawing-widget/2176) in having the CHT support the ability for a CHT to collect a hand drawn signature from a patient.  With this release, app developers may now implement the draw widget in "signature" mode.  Here is an example of both the draw widget and signature widget on a demo app in the CHT:
