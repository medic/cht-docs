## Upgrade notes

There are no breaking changes when upgrading from 3.1.x.

## Muting

You can now mute people and places which stops any scheduled messages from being sent and updates the UI for that contact. [[#4767](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4767)]

For more information read the [feature overview](https://github.com/medic/medic-docs/raw/91badc2a347f86fd2b42b1c9ab9527b5982ee9c0/Muting%20Features%20Overview.pdf) and the [configuration documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/transitions/#muting).

## UHC performance

If you have UHC configured loading contacts is now much faster. [[#4768](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4768)]
