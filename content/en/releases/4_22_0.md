## Highlights

### Support Centralized SMS Gateway of Nepal run by Department of IT

The Department of IT, Nepal has been running the centralized SMS gateway for a few years.
Initially, it was focused on sending Bulk SMS, but now it can send A2P (Application to Person) SMS via API.
The goal of this functionality is to enable CHT Core to use this gateway to send SMS messages in Ministry of Health projects.

See the [documentation](/building/messaging/gateways/nepal_doit/) for more details on configuration and functionality.
