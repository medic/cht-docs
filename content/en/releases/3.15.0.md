## Highlights

### Support reporting of Bikram Sambat dates using JSON forms

SMS forms can now include a date form for submitting an exact date in Bikram Sambat format. Learn how to use this feature in [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/forms/#app_settingsjson-forms).

[#4613](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4613): Support reporting of dates as exact date using text forms

### A new API for adding users in bulk

Previously there was an API for creating a single user but this feature adds an API for creating multiple users in one go. This is particularly useful when setting up a new project or expanding into a new area. Find out more about the API in [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/#post-apiv1users).

[#7490](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7490): Add API to create many users

### Faster app loading for users on weak internet connections

The CHT webapp is now fully [Offline-First](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/offline-first/) which means the app starts just as quickly whether you have fast internet, slow internet, or no internet at all. In the worst case the application startup used to take over 2 minutes, but with this fix it now takes around 1 second.
