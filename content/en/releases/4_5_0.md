## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

- [#8513](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/8513): Align "Target" components with Material design guidelines
- [#8541](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/8541): Options with long names look wrong in enketo selects


## Highlights

### Schedules can be created by passing array on start_from

It is now possible to configure the `start_from` property to accept array of fields while configuring SMS schedules. This allows users to pass multiple fields and the first existing field will be used to create schedules. Read more about schedules in [the documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/schedules/#app_settingsjson-schedules).

### Target components are updated to match material design

The targets UI has been updated to match [material design](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/overview). This is the next step in transitioning to using a modern and intuitive design throughout the UI. Many other components were updated in [4.4.0](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/releases/4.4.0/#uiux-changes).

### Outbound tasks can be configured on a schedule

The CHT now supports scheduling when outbound push tasks are run based on a cron expression. Read about how to set this up in the [outbound push documentation]({{< relref "building/reference/app-settings/outbound#cron" >}}).
