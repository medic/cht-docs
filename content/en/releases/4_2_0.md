## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

#### Floating Action Button

The additive actions (creating reports, places, people, etc...) have moved from the bottom action bar to a Floating Action Button that opens a menu with all actions. This change aligns the CHT more closely with Android UX and [material design patterns](https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview), and applies to the Messages, Reports, and Contacts tab.

NOTE: The bottom action bar can be temporarily re-enabled for specific users by granting them the `can_view_old_action_bar` permission; however, it will be completely removed in a future release. See the [Feature Flags](/community/contributing/code/core/feature-flags) documentation for more information.

#### More Options menu

The Export, Edit, and Delete actions have moved from the bottom action bar to a new More Option (⋮) menu located on the top right side of the screen. This change aligns the CHT more closely with Android UX and [material design patterns](https://m3.material.io/components/menus/overview), and applies to the Messages, Reports, and Contacts tab.

NOTE: The bottom action bar can be temporarily re-enabled for specific users by granting them the `can_view_old_action_bar` permission; however, it will be completely removed in a future release. See the [Feature Flags](/community/contributing/code/core/feature-flags) documentation for more information.

## Highlights

### Training Cards

A new feature was added to help health workers learn about changes to their CHT app remotely, directly in their app. Training Card content might include information about a newly deployed feature, changes to a [care guide](/building/care-guides), or simply a reminder about an underused feature or workflow. You can read more about it in the [Training Cards documentation](/building/training/training-cards) and find some template content in the [resources](/building/training/training-cards-resources) section on the documentation site to help you get started with Training Cards.

### Support automatically creating users when contact is added

When configured, users will automatically be created when certain types of person contacts are added. No intervention from a system administrator is required in this process.

For example, a supervisor could onboard a new CHW just by creating a new person contact for them with a “create contact” form.  The new user for the CHW will automatically be created and the CHW will receive an SMS message containing the token login link. This link will allow them to login as the newly created user.

You can read more about it in [the transitions configuration docs](/building/reference/app-settings/transitions#create_user_for_contacts)!

### Extension libraries

The extension libraries are blocks of code that are cached with the CHT web application giving app developers a powerful tool to extend the CHT. An example of a use for this feature is to provide a function to calculate a risk score based on a machine learning model. The function can then be called passing in values from [app forms](/building/forms/app) and return the result to be stored with the report.

Read more about this feature in the [extension libraries docs](/building/reference/extension-libs)

### Initial replication improvements

After refactoring the initial replication mechanism, which is the process of synchronizing data for the first time between the user's device and the app's server, it is now at least 8 times faster than before. Look at this performance comparison table:

No. concurrent users | Before (median) | After (median)
-- | -- | --
1 | 251s | 18s
10 | 86s | 11s
100 | 25m | 2.5m
