## Known issues

Check the repository for the [latest known issues](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Affects%3A+4.17.0%22).

## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

The login experience now includes a **password reset page** for users who are required to change their password upon first login. This page ensures that new users and users whose passwords have been manually updated by an admin are prompted to update their credentials before accessing the app.

See the [workflow documentation]( {{< ref "building/concepts/access#password-reset-on-first-login" >}} ) for more details.

## Highlights

### Change password on first login

System admin users create accounts for CHWs and then share the password with them. To enhance the security of these accounts, the CHT now [supports a feature]( {{< ref "building/concepts/access#password-reset-on-first-login" >}} ) that prompts users to change their password upon their first login.

#### Details
- By default, new users and users whose passwords have been manually reset by an admin must change their password on their next login.
- This requirement can be bypassed for specific user roles using the [`can_skip_password_change` permission]( {{< ref "building/reference/app-settings/user-permissions#system-defined-permissions" >}} ).
  - If the permission is **enabled** for a user, they will **not** be required to change their password.
  - If the permission is **not enabled**, the user **must** change their password before accessing the app.
- Subsequent logins won’t require a password change unless the admin manually updates the user’s password. In this case, the user will be prompted to change their password on their next login.
- If the user cannot change the password for any reason, they will be unable to access the app.
- If a user logs in for the first time, but closes the app before changing their password, they will be prompted again to change their password the next time they open the app.
