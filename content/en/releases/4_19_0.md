## Highlights

### Prevent duplicate sibling contact capture

{{< figure link="../images/4_19_0-duplicate-contact-screenshot.png" src="../images/4_19_0-duplicate-contact-screenshot.png" >}}

Contacts are created/modified via highly configurable [contact forms](/building/forms/contact). One major challenge when collecting contact data is ensuring users do not inadvertently enter duplicate records for the same contact.
The CHT now supports automatically detecting when a contact being created or edited by a user matches an existing contact record. If a duplicate contact is detected, the user will be given the option of proceeding to the profile of the existing contact. Alternatively, the user can choose to override the duplicate detection logic and continue creating/editing the contact as originally intended.

See [the documentation]( {{< ref "/building/contact-management/contacts/#duplicate-contact-detection" >}} ) for more details.

### Add user-agent header to outgoing requests

The CHT now includes the `user-agent` header in all outgoing requests. This header includes the Operating System and architecture of the server running the CHT, as well as the version of the CHT.
