## Highlights

### Storage Pressure Indicator

{{< figure src="/building/navigation/storage_pressure_screenshot.svg" link="/building/navigation/storage_pressure_screenshot.svg" >}}

The performance and functionality of the CHT app on an offline user's device can be significantly affected when there is not sufficient free disk space. The [storage pressure indicator](/building/navigation/#storage-pressure-indicator) in the menu drawer shows users, at a glance, how much free disk space they have left.

### Single Sign-On (OIDC)

{{< figure src="/hosting/sso/sso-login-flow.svg" link="/hosting/sso/sso-login-flow.svg" >}}

Single Sign-On (SSO) enables users connecting to a CHT instance to authenticate with credentials from an external SSO provider instead of needing a CHT-specific username and password. For example, if an organization has issued Microsoft accounts to its users, then the [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/what-is-entra) service could be integrated with the CHT to allow users to log in using their Microsoft credentials.

SSO authentication is implemented with the industry standard [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/) (OIDC) protocol. Any OIDC-compliant authentication server can be integrated with the CHT.

See [the documentation](/hosting/sso) for more details on configuration and functionality.

### Improved Audit Log

The old HAProxy audit log system has been [removed](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9873) in this release and it has been replaced by a much improved database powered audit system. CHT now maintains a complete change history by tracking all document modifications in a dedicated `medic-audit` database. 

The CHT docs now have a [document auditing page](/technical-overview/data/audit/) covering all the technical details.
