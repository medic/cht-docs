### UI/UX changes

- [#9957](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9957): Implement task sorting by priority


## Highlights

### Sorting tasks by priority and then due date

When many tasks are due or overdue,
it's overwhelming or almost impossible for CHWs to effectively evaluate which tasks are most urgent.
4.21.0 introduces a new default way of sorting tasks in the frontend, based on the task priority score,
with the tasks with the highest priority appearing at the top of the list.
The priority score is a number calculated based on task configuration. 
If the project configuration does not implement the new priority scoring, the task sorting will remain unchanged,
with tasks being sorted by their due date.

See [the documentation]({{< ref "/building/tasks/tasks-overview/#task-prioritization" >}}) for more details on configuration and functionality.

### Accessing the logged-in user's contact summary in app forms and app forms permissions

Workflows becoming more complex require additional context data to be correct and accurate.
To bridge a gap in context data,
the logged-in user's contact summary is now available in app forms and app forms properties.
This allows hiding/displaying forms depending on the current user's context
and allows data about the logged-in user to be used in form calculations.       

See [the form inputs documentation]({{< ref "building/forms/configuring/form-inputs/#user-contact-summary-data" >}}) and [the form properties documentation]({{< ref "building/forms/app/#formsappform_namepropertiesjson" >}}) for more details on configuration and functionality.

### Support opening contact edit form from task

Task actions with `type: 'contact'` can now be configured to redirect the user to the contact form to edit a contact, while this feature previously only allowed redirecting to a contact form to create a contact. 

See [the documentation]({{< ref "building/tasks/managing-tasks/launch-contact-form" >}}) for more details on configuration and functionality.
