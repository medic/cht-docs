## Bug fixes

### Unicode form codes not clearing schedules

When using non-Latin characters in a form code our software failed to find the right schedules to clear so unwanted messages were being sent. This affects versions from 3.0.0 to 3.4.0. [medic#5698](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5698)
