## Highlights

### Performance

The Contacts page loads much faster now. Using [apdex scores and testing on low spec devices](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/evaluating-app-performance-using-apdex-lets-dive-in-and-look-at-an-example/3475), we were able to identify slow areas and make improvements to both the [list view](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/performance-improvements-on-the-contacts-page-list-view/3501) and the [detail view](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/performance-improvements-on-the-contacts-page-detail-view/3486).

#### Apdex Improvements

{{< figure src="../images/4.8.0-apdex-improvements.png" >}}

- [#9006](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9006): Improves performance of the list view by reducing the number of rows fetched each time
- [#9019](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/9019): Improves performance of the detail view by reducing loops for tasks and reports


### Security

Two security issues with severity level of "high" and one of "low" were fixed in this release. The long standing security issues were detected during routine penetration tests. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible to get the best possible cybersecurity protection.
