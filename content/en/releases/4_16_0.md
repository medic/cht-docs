## Highlights

### Upgrading to CouchDb 3.4.2

CouchDb 3.4.2 comes bundled by default with CHT Core 4.16.0 and includes a multitude of improvements, such as:
- Adds Nouveau, an implementation of Lucene, which will be used in the near future for improved freetext searching
- Improved security by adding a new, more secure and more performant password hashing algorithm
- An alternative JavaScript view engine, which has improved performance when indexing views. The CHT is not yet ready for switching to this engine, as the two engines are not fully compatible, but will be in a future release.

The upgrade to the new version of CouchDb should be seamless and covered by the generic CHT Core upgrade, without additional intervention.

### Arabic as CHT language

The CHT is soon expanding its reach through adding support for Right-To-Left written languages. As part of the initial effort on this path, version 4.16.0 adds Arabic translations for Webapp, while the required UI changes for complete RTL support are to be added in a future version.
