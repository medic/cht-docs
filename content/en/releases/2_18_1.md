## What's New

### Count two visits on the same day as one visit

If a family is visited twice on the same day it now only counts as one visit in UHC mode. [[#4897](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4897)]

### Inputs group not saved when its relevance is set to false

Form inputs are now always saved on the reports even when they are marked as not relevant to help with analytics and editing forms. [[#4875](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/4875)]
