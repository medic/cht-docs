## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

To prepare for this release, please read through our [Preparing to Upgrade documentation]({{< ref "building/guides/updates/preparing-for-4" >}}).

> [!WARNING] 
> Be aware that as this is a major upgrade some manual steps are required - following the usual upgrade process will not work. [Data migration documentation is coming soon]({{< ref "hosting/4.x" >}}), but in the meantime please reach out on [the forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) for direct support in upgrading. New projects should start on 4.0.0 to make the following upgrades easier.

#### New architecture

This is a significant change how the CHT is deployed and updated which brings a wide range of benefits and enables more opportunities for improvements in future releases. Read more about [the new architecture](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/next-generation-cht-architecture/1537).

- [#6189](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6189): Implement Architecture v3

#### Updated browser and Android requirements

The requirements of clients (browsers and Android devices) has been updated to allow the CHT to use modern features and benefit from improved performance and security. Before upgrading to CHT v4.0.0 ensure that:

- All Android devices are running AndroidOS v5.0 or greater. In most cases this will require replacing older devices.
- All Android devices are running [cht-android](https://github.com/medic/cht-android/) v1.0 or greater
- All Android devices are running [Android System Webview](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview) v100 or greater
- Browser users have the most recent version of Chrome or Firefox

All these updates are backwards compatible so these should be rolled out **before** upgrading the CHT server.

#### Upgraded Enketo

The software the CHT uses to render forms has been updated with more features, better performance, and many bug fixes. This also introduces a few changes to behavior that may require changes to form configuration. To test your forms

1. Use the latest [cht-conf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cht-conf) CLI tool to validate your forms. Some additional validations were added to detect issues you may have.
2. Upgrade a testing instance to 4.0.0 and manually test the forms to ensure they work as expected.

- [#6345](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6345): Update to latest enketo-core
- [#7731](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7731): Update `today` XPath function to not return current time

#### Secure credentials migration

Credentials used for external integration via SIH or Outbound Push features are now stored in a different way which requires a manual upgrade step. Read about how to store credentials in 4.0.0 in the [API documentation]({{< ref "building/reference/api#credentials" >}}).

- [#5904](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5904): Cluster safe credentials

#### Removed deprecated features

Simprints integration and the `update_sent_forms` transition weren't being used so the code has been removed.

- [#5939](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5939): Remove `update_sent_forms` transition
- [#7421](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7421): Remove simprints code

### UI/UX changes

None.

## Highlights

### New architecture

The major feature of CHT v4.0.0 is a new micro service architecture. This has many benefits over the previous architecture outlined in more detail in [this forum post](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/t/next-generation-cht-architecture/1537), but in summary this allows deployments to scale to many more users than previously, deployments to be updated more easily in future, better monitoring of services, performance gains, removing quite a lot of legacy code, and easier installation.

- [#6189](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6189): Implement Architecture v3

### API startup progress screen

Previously users who tried to log in before server start up had completed would be shown an error page which wasn't very user friendly. Now users will be shown loading page with details about the current stage of the start up process.
