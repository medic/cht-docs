### Buttons
Primary buttons are used for actions, such as “Next” and “Submit”. Secondary buttons are the alternative to the primary action, such as "Previous". Text links are used for less important or less commonly used actions, such as “Cancel”.

### Inputs
Use an input field as a basic text control to enable the user to type a small amount of text. The input size should reflect the amount of text a user is expected to enter. When necessary, use a descriptive error state.
