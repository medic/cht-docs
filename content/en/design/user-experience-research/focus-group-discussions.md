  How to collect data from several users simultaneously
---

Focus group discussions are a quick and convenient way to collect data from several users simultaneously. Use focus group discussions to gain insight into what users think about a topic or shared experience in a group setting and to learn about opinions, attitudes and preferences. 

## Planning

1. Identify your research objectives
2. Develop your focus group discussion guide
3. Establish timelines and resources required:
    1. Recording equipment
    2. Stationary
    3. Personnel (facilitator, moderator)
    4. Location
    5. Mobile devices

Here is a [focused group discussion template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DISQpIr8EbkFaSBMHZEXLwOrhzIxd1JmSZbMFWjqFo/edit?tab=t.0).

## Recruiting

1. Aim for 4-6 groups
2. With 6-10 users per group 
3. Mixed user groups are ideal, consider the variety of:
    1. Engagement (active vs inactive users)
    2. Technical literacy
    3. Location
    4. Age
    5. Role
    6. Experience with the CHT

## Executing

1. The moderator welcomes the group and does introductions
2. The moderator explains what is going to happen in the session and the objectives of the discussion group and allows users to ask any clarifying questions
3. The facilitator hands out any materials if needed, asks for recording consent and sets up the recording device 
4. The facilitator takes notes of the session
5. The moderator goes through the discussion guide and steers the conversation until all topics are covered
6. Thank the users for their participation, ask them if they have any questions and let them know their feedback is important in improving the CHT

#### Tips:

* Ask open ended questions
* Make sure everyone gets to speak
* Focus on one question at a time
* Donâ€™t share your assumptions or hypotheses
* Do not influence the user by asking leading questions
* Record your session or have someone take notes so you can focus on being present

## Synthesizing

Identify themes that emerged from the focused group discussions and consider the analysis of the groups likes, dislikes, any emotive words, mental models, existing problems or issues and group ideas for opportunities.

Review recording and notes to identify emerging themes, considering:

* Likes and dislikes
* Emotive words
* Mental models
* Problems or issues
* Ideas or opportunities
