## Remember
* Be warm, but professional. 
* Record audio when possible. 
* Sample real experiences, don’t ask for opinions (ex. Tell me about the last time you did XYZ). 
* No leading questions or examples of answers. 
* Silence is OK – give participants time to think about the question. 
* If the participant doesn’t understand the question, take a moment to rephrase it. Think about the insight you are trying to uncover. 
* Avoid becoming the expert. Even if the participant is doing something incorrectly, don’t correct them. Starting to correct them will also negatively change the dynamic of the interview.
