  How to conduct Customer Effort Score surveys
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

Customer Effort Score surveys are used to quantitatively assess the ease of use of your CHT app.

## Planning

1. Identify the key CHT workflows or tasks that are of interest to your program
2. Create your survey to assess the difficulty of each of the above
3. Establish the cadence in which to send the survey to users 

> [!TIP] Tips
> * Use simple language in your survey questions 
> * Aim to keep the survey quick to complete, asking between 8-15 questions 
> * Use the 5-point likert scale

Here is a [sample CES survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TuD9G4Gjod07jtw4INOWEkoBzuu9pEooSz-UfASjlyc/edit).

## Recruiting

* Sample 20-50 users across the deployment sites
* Recruit on a recurring basis if necessary to gauge improvement on each area

## Executing

The survey can either be:

1. Self-administered 
    * The facilitator sends the questionnaire to the users directly upon which they fill and submit without any assistance
2. Moderated
    * The facilitator guides users through the questions as a group or individually 

## Synthesizing

Calculate the average score for each question to assess the overall ease of use and areas for opportunity for improvement.
