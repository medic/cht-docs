## Remember
* Be warm, but professional.
* Record audio when possible.
* Sample real experiences, don’t ask for opinions (ex. Tell me about the last time you did XYZ).
* No leading questions or examples of answers.
* Silence is OK – give participants time to think about the question.
* If the participant doesn’t understand the question, take a moment to rephrase it. Think about the insight you are trying to uncover.
* Avoid becoming the expert. Even if the participant is doing something incorrectly, don’t correct them. Starting to correct them will also negatively change the dynamic of the interview.
