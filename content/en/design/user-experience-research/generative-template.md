## Remember
* Be warm, but professional.
* Record audio when possible.
* Sample real experiences, don’t ask for opinions (ex. Tell me about the last time you did XYZ).
* No leading questions or examples of answers.
* Silence is OK – give participants time to think about the question.
* If the participant doesn’t understand the question, take a moment to rephrase it. Think about the insight you are trying to uncover.
* Avoid becoming the expert. Even if the participant is doing something incorrectly, don’t correct them. Starting to correct them will also negatively change the dynamic of the interview.

## Mission
_Why are you doing this research? This is your North Star reminder of how this session will help your initiative forward_

Sampling unbiased CHW experiences with the CHT to help understand how to improve their user experience

## Learning objectives
_In the discovery phase, your objectives likely include better understanding user context and pain. You might want to learn what tools or services they are currently using to solve their existing pains, and to test your hypothesis. List these objectives here so you can refer to them._

To learn about, in as much detail as possible, the last time a CHW used the CHT

## Script

### Intro

#### Probe further to understand

* How often do they open their app, and why (ex. What is their schedule)? 
* When do they decide to visit a household, and how do they prioritize? 
* What stood out as easy to do with the app?

* Overview of all services provided (not just health related) for their communities 
   * Tools that currently support this 
   * Things they manage by memory


### Conclusion
