  The "typical" users of CHT Applications across diverse contexts
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

User personas give you a common understanding of who you are serving, particularly when working across diverse contexts. Your global personas are based on "typical" users, knowing that some variation is present in different settings.

Being explicit about who are you designing with and for, and understanding what’s important to them helps you prioritize features, make better design decisions, and optimize impact.
