  The "typical" users of CHT Apps across diverse contexts

User personas give us a common understanding of who we are serving, particularly when working across diverse contexts. Our global personas are based on “typical” users, knowing that some variation is present in different settings.

Being explicit about who are we designing with and for, and understanding what’s important to them helps us prioritize features, make better design decisions, and optimize impact.
