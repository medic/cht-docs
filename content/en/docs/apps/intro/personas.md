## User Personas

We’ve used the Core Framework to build apps for a variety of users, including community health workers (CHWs), CHW supervisors, nurses, system administrators, and other people who deliver care and support.

User personas give us a common understanding of who we are serving, particularly when working across diverse contexts. Our global personas are based on “typical” users, knowing that some variation is present in different settings.

Being explicit about who are we designing with and for, and understanding what’s important to them helps us prioritize features, make better design decisions, and optimize impact.

### Community Health Worker (CHW)

CHWs are the central users of apps built with the Core Framework. They conduct household visits and are responsible for the health of their community. CHWs typically live in and are chosen by their community. Their degree of health training, responsibilities, and support depends upon their country and program. Many are unpaid volunteers, though a growing number receive wages or incentives. Most operate as a CHW on a part-time basis while engaging in farming or other income-generating activities. Most CHWs are responsible for:
- Registering new people and families
- Conducting guided health assessments
- Screening for and tracking specific conditions
- Providing basic medicines and health supplies
- Reporting danger signs & referring to the clinic
- Following up about clinic visits and care

### CHW supervisor

The CHW supervisor is the person who trains and supports CHWs and helps them meet their monthly goals. Supervisors usually split their time between administrative duties at the local health facility and accompanying CHWs on their community visits. Most CHW supervisors are responsible for:
- Training CHWs and reinforcing health knowledge and protocols
- Following up with CHWs on high-priority cases 
- Liaising with the facility-based staff on the needs at the community level
- Mobilizing CHWs to educate community on health promotion campaigns
- Tracking progress towards key impact metrics and helping CHWs reach their targets
- Aggregating CHW data and reporting on activities to health system officials

### Nurse

Nurses are stationed at the health facility and spend their days seeing patients. They are very busy and may see 50 or more patients a day. At the clinic, they sometimes deal with staff shortages, stock-outs, and poor internet connectivity. They help train and manage CHWs, particularly during monthly meetings at the facility. They are interested in seeing improvements in health metrics for the areas their facility serves.  Most nurses are responsible for:
- Assessing patients and providing primary care 
- Reporting service delivery statistics to health system officials
- Coordinating care for high-priority patients through CHWs and supervisors
- Initiating events to promote healthy practices in the community

### Data Manager

Data Managers are often based at a regional health facility and serve many local facilities. They are responsible for collating and reporting on community and health system data. Their work often involves following up with supervisors and nurses to verify data and retrieve missing information. Most data managers are responsible for:
- Collecting health system data from the field
- Verifying data for accuracy and completeness
- Aggregating data and providing reports to nurses, supervisors, and health system officials with raw numbers and trends on key metrics
