## Building Apps With the CHT Core Framework

The Core Framework makes it faster to build full-featured, scalable digital health apps by providing a foundation developers can build on. These apps can support most languages, are offline-first, and work on basic phones (via SMS), smartphones, tablets, and computers. 

App developers are able to define health system roles, permissions and reporting hierarchies, and make use of five highly configurable areas of functionality: messaging, task and schedule management, decision support workflows, longitudinal person profiles, and analytics. 

The Core Framework can be used to support the unique needs of a given health system and the work of community health workers, frontline supervisors, facility-based nurses, health system managers, and even patients and caregivers.

### Responsive Web App Model

A responsive web app is a hybrid of a website and a mobile application. On desktop and laptop computers, it runs in the web browser. On Android devices (such as cell phones or tablets), it is downloaded as an app. The same source code powers the experience, meaning that the app you see on your desktop is the same app you see on your mobile device. 

Web apps built with the Core Framework are fully responsive, which means content will scale to fill the available space. Users accessing the app on a mobile device will see a single-panel mobile layout. Users accessing the app on a desktop or laptop device will see a two-panel layout.

### Offline-First Technology

Digital health apps need to support health systems in a wide range of low infrastructure environments. Apps built with the Core Framework are designed to be offline-first and work with only an occasional internet connection.

These apps store a user’s data locally on their device so that workflows can be completed without syncing to the server. When a connection becomes available, data will automatically sync to and from the server. Offline-first technology enables health workers to carry out important duties even when opportunities to sync may be weeks apart. As with any app, there is a limit to how much data can be stored locally, particularly on a mobile device. For users needing access to large amounts of data, online user roles are available. 

### Made for Localization

Apps can be customized for different deployments and types of workflows. The Core Framework has been used in dozens of countries around the world with [localization settings]({{< ref "localization" >}}).

Users can currently interact with the app in English, French, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish, Swahili, or Indonesian and new languages can be added in the admin console. The app also supports Bikram Sambat or Gregorian calendars and localized date formatting.


### Reference Apps

The Community Health Toolkit’s Reference Apps provide organizations with a template for structuring and organizing a community health workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework. They include a foundation for forms, data fields, and even analytics, and can be deployed as-is or easily customized by a developer for your unique context.
