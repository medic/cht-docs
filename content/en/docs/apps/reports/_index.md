  Reports for Data & Report Management
---

The Reports tab is where you can access any data that was submitted. Depending on how often you anticipate a user needing to access this tab, you can configure it to show in the main tabs list (preferable for admin users) or in the secondary hamburger menu (preferably for CHW users). 

The permissions set for your role and your placement in the hierarchy will determine which reports you’re able to see on this tab. As a rule, you can only view reports submitted by yourself or those below you in the hierarchy. Therefore, CHWs will only see reports that they submitted on this tab, while supervisors will see reports that they submitted as well as those submitted by their CHWs.

## Main List

The first line of bold text is the name of the person whom the report is about. The second line of text is the name of the report, and the third line of text is the hierarchy of place to which that person belongs. In the upper right corner, a timestamp displays when the report was submitted. Reports are sorted by submission date, with the most recent reports at the top. If a report is unread, the timestamp will be bold blue and there will be a horizontal blue line above it. 

We have a “review” feature that allows managers to indicate whether a report has been reviewed and if it contains errors. If a manager has marked a report as “correct,” a green checkmark will show below the timestamp. If a report is marked as “has errors,” a red ‘X’ will show. This same icon is used for invalid SMS messages.

## Filters & Search

The toolbar at the top of the page includes filters and search to help users narrow down the list or search for and find a specific report. These filters are configurable and could include:

- **Report Types** (e.g. pregnancy registration, visits, delivery report)
- **Places** (e.g. districts, health centers or CHW areas)
- **Date of Submission**
- **Status** (e.g. not reviewed, has errors, correct, valid SMS, invalid SMS)

Using the search box, you can search for reports by patient name, phone number, ID number and more. To reset the filters or the search and view  the full list of forms, click on the reset icon on the right side of the toolbar.

## Action Buttons

The action buttons at the bottom of the screen are configurable. Options include adding or completing a care guide, bulk select & export. 

Clicking the “+” button opens a menu of forms a user can choose to complete. “Bulk Select,” represented by a checkmark icon within a circle, allows you to bulk select and delete multiple reports at a time.

**Please Note**: Bulk delete cannot be undone. If in doubt, do not delete! You can restrict a user’s access to this feature in the permissions for their role. 

Clicking on the “Export” button will download a CSV file with all of the data from the reports.

## Detail Pages

You can click on any report to view a report detail page. Here you'll find the name and phone number of the user who submitted the report as well as responses to the questions within it. If the report initiated a schedule of SMS messages, you will see the messages queued to send.

The buttons at the bottom are configurable. The ones you see will depend on your user role, permissions, and hierarchy. 

- **Send a Message**​: Opens the Messages page to send a message to the person who submitted the report
- **Review**: Mark as “correct” or “has errors”
- **Edit**: Opens the form to edit it
- **Delete**: Deletes a report ( cannot be undone)
