The UI of muted family member profiles also updates to make their muted status clear and easily recognizable.

* The family icon turns grey
*   A status of “Muted” displays on the second line below

    the person’s name
* Any condition cards that were previously on the profile, such as Pregnancy or Immunization, remain
* Any actions that were previously available on the person’s profile remain available. Any actions that were previously available on the family remain available on the profile.
* Instead of the “Mute” form, there is now “Unmute”
* If an action is begun on a muted person, there will be a warning message saying “This person is currently muted. Are you sure you want to proceed?”
