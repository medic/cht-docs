* To mute a family, navigate to the family profile, open up the action window, and select the “Mute” form
* If accessing the “Mute” form from the Reports tab, you first need to choose a contact to mute from a dropdown list
* A question on the form asks “What is the reason for muting?” and provides options (exact form questions and options are configurable)
* &#x20;If the project has not been configured to require a manager verification step, the family will be muted as soon as the user clicks the “Submit” button (assuming the user is connected to the server)
* If the partner does require manager verification, a task will be sent to the manager to confirm the muting status change. The family will remain active until the manager confirms the muting.
