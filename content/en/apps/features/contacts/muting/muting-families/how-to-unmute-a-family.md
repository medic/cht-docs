# How to unmute a family

* Families can be unmuted by submitting an “Unmute” form from the main family profile or from any family member profile. The unmute form can also be accessed via the Reports page.
* The Unmute form asks about the reason for unmuting (exact questions and options configurable).
* When a family is unmuted, all individuals in the family will be unmuted at the same time.
* Unmuting an individual person in a muted family works essentially the same way, unmuting the entire family and all other family members in it (because we don’t allow unmuted individuals underneath a muted household).
* Any unmuted family schedules should pick up right on track
