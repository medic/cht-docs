* “muting\_history” can be found in the info-docs saved inmedic-sentinel database
*   Each entry includes the following information:

    ○  a Boolean “muted” property, describing the new state

    ○  an ISO formatted “date” describing when the action was processed

    ○  a “report\_id” property which contains the “\_id” of the report that triggered the action
