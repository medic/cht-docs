<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Muted person in active family profile</p></figcaption></figure>

If a single person is muted, but the family they belong to was/is active, the family as a whole remains styled “active” and only the individual person in the muted family members list updates.

* The main family icon remains pink, and there is no label “Muted” underneath the family name, since the entire family is not muted
* The muted individual(s) in the family members list have grey text for their names and display the label “Muted”.
