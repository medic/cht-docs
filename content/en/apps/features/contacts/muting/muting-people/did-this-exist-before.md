# Did this exist before?



* We already partially supported individual muting with the On/Off form, however this functionality muted pre-existing SMS schedules only and did not “mark” or style the person as muted.
* We’ve done some additional development to update this functionality and convert it into a true individual mute function that works logically with the new family/place muting features.
* Moving forward, muting an individual will mark them as “muted”, make the UI changes to their profile to reflect the “Muted” status, and mute all pre-existing and future schedules.
