* To mute a person, navigate to the person’s profile, open the action window, and select the “Mute” form
* If accessing the “Mute” form from the Reports tab, you first need to choose a contact to mute from a dropdown list
* A question on the form asks “What is the reason for muting?” and provides options (exact form questions and options are configurable)
* If the project has not been configured to require a manager verification step, the person will be muted as soon as the user clicks the “Submit” button (assuming the user is connected to the server)
* If the partner does require manager verification, a task will be sent to the manager to confirm the muting status change. The person will remain active until the manager confirms the muting.
