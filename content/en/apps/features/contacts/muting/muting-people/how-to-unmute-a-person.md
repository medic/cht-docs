* People can be unmuted by submitting an “Unmute” form from the person’s profile. The unmute form can also be accessed via the Reports page.
* The Unmute form asks about the reason for unmuting (exact questions and options configurable).
* If a person belongs to a muted family or place, unmuting them unmutes the family or place levels above them at the same time.
* Any unmuted schedules for the person (such as pregnancy ANC schedule) should pick up on track
