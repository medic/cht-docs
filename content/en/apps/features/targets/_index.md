<!-- ## Targets: Performance Dashboards -->

Targets is a user dashboard or analytics tab. These widgets provide a summary or analysis of the data in reports that have been submitted. These widgets can be configured to track metrics for an individual CHW or for an entire health facility. Currently, the user must have access to the report in order to generate the widget with its data.

For CHWs, the Targets tab can provide a quick summary of their progress towards their goals. For supervisors, nurses, and other facility-based users, these widgets might display important insights into how their community unit is performing.

Targets can be configured for any user that has offline access.

## Types of Widgets

There are two basic types of widgets: counts and percentages. Count widgets display a number while percentage widgets display a horizontal bar that represents 100%. Every element is configurable, including the text, the icon, the presence of a goal (or not), the value of the goal, the time frame, and the total number of widgets.

The data for both widgets is calculated as either “this month” (resets back to 0 at the beginning of each month) or “all time” (a cumulative total). The time frame is per widget level so there can be a mix of date ranges on the Targets page. 

Additionally, each widget can have a goal and there can be a mix of widgets with and without goals. If goals are set, the widgets have conditional color styling to show whether a goal is unmet (red) or met (green) based on configured rules.

### Count Widgets

The count widget shows a tally of a particular report that’s been submitted or data within a report that matches a set of criteria. 

For example, you could count the number of active pregnancies, the number of facility-based deliveries, or the number of households or people registered that month.

Counts without a goal display a simple black number count. Counts with a goal display the value of the goal on the right side and a colored count (green if the count is above the goal, or red if the count is below the goal).

### Percent Widgets

Percentage widgets provide insight into how much data matches a specific criteria against data that does not. This is calculated based on a true / false statement. This is often configured to represent accomplishment. For example, newborns should be visited within the first three days of life (“true”) can be displayed next to newborns that were not visited within the first three days (“false”).

Next to the percentage, the count of reports used in the calculation are shown (e.g. 16 of 20 [newborn visits] on-time). CHWs have found this helpful in interpreting this information. 

An optional goal can be set, such as “70% of newborns should be visited within the first three days.” Conditional styling can be configured to show green if a goal has been met and red if the goal has not been met.
