## Overview

The app runs on most any modern computer with the newest versions of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Hardware & Software Requirements

Hardware procurement, ownership, and management is the responsibility of each implementing organization. We strongly urge all organizations to procure hardware locally to ensure ease of replacement, repair, sustainability, and hardware support when needed.


## Accessing on Desktop

On desktop devices, there is no need to download anything. Simply go to a web browser and type in your unique URL, for example:

`{{projectname}}.app.medicmobile.org`

## Accessing on Mobile

The app also runs with an app on Android phones and tablets. It works best on devices running version 5.1 or later with at least 8 GB of internal memory (16 GB for supervisors) and minimum 1 GHz RAM.

### Downloading

To download your app on a mobile device, first navigate to the Google Play Store. From there, click on the search icon in the upper right, and type in the custom name of your health app or project. Make sure the app shown is the correct one and then select it. Then, click on the “Install” button to begin the download. 

### Launching

Once the download is complete, you can access your app via an app icon in your applications menu. Note that the icon, as well as the app name displayed, is customizable by the organization or project.

## Logging In

When accessing your app for the very first time, a login page is displayed. Users enter a username and password that grant access to their customized app experience.

On mobile devices, the app generally stays logged in after initial setup so that CHW users don’t have to type in their credentials each day. 

On desktop devices, the user must login again if they close the app tab or browser window.

Users may log out by going to the options menu available in the top right corner of the app.

## Summary of Page Tabs

Page tabs are the primary method of navigating in your app. The number of tabs is variable depending on the user’s role and place in the hierarchy. For example, non-admin users don’t have Messages. The Reports tab is accessible to CHWs but often tucked away inside the secondary menu drawer.
- **People​**: This is where profiles of districts, staff, CHWs and patients live
- **Tasks​**: This is a list of upcoming visits, follow-ups, or other required tasks
- **Targets**: Displays real-time visualizations of key activity and impact indicators
- **Reports​**: A detailed history of all forms submitted by CHWs and other staff
- **Messages​**: A place for community-based staff to send and exchange messages

## The Menu Drawer

Tap the menu icon in the upper right corner of the header to access other pages, edit personal settings, view sync status and more.
- **Admin Console**: Change advanced app settings (only admin users will see this)
- **Guided Tour**: Review new features and important tips
- **About**: View your app version and other detailed database information 
- **User Settings**: Update basic user information like email, phone number, and password
- **Report Bug**: Let us know if something isn’t working or you encounter errors
- **Log Out**: Sign out of the app

## Sync Status

At the bottom of the menu is a notification which provides important about sync status. It lets you know whether reports are being submitted.

If the sync status is green and says “All reports synced,” your reports have been sent. This means you have successfully uploaded all of your data to the server. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have downloaded all of the most recent data from the server.

If the indicator is red, it means there are still reports waiting to send. This means you have not successfully uploaded all of your  data to the server. You should check your internet and data connection.
