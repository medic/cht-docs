This tutorial will take you through customising some graphical elements of CHT core.

You will cover site branding, partner logos, header tab icons, and app icons (used in tasks, targets, and contacts).

{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Required Resources

You should have a functioning [CHT instance with `cht-conf` installed locally]({{< ref "apps/tutorials/local-setup" >}}) and completed a [project folder]({{< ref "apps/tutorials/local-setup#3-create-and-upload-a-blank-project" >}}) setup.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Site branding

You have the ability to modify the app title, logo, and favicon. For Progressive Web App installations you can also configure the desktop icon.

{{< figure src="branding_elements.png" link="branding_elements.png" class="center col-6 col-lg-8" >}}

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| **logo** | Should be less than 100KB, have a transparent background, have high contrast, and be horizontal in shape with a ratio of about 3.5:1. We recommend SVG or PNG image formats. |
| **favicon** | Ideally 32x32 pixels, simple, and very small in size. We recommend SVG or PNG image formats. |
| **icon** | Must be at least 192x192 pixels, square. We recommend SVG or PNG image formats. |

#### Using cht-conf

Create a `branding.json` file if it doesn't exist. (This may have already been created by the initialise-project-layout command).
Edit the file with the following content:

```json
 {
   "title": "My App Name",
   "resources": {
     "logo": "logo.png",
     "favicon": "favicon.ico",
     "icon": "pwa-icon.svg" // required for PWA installation only
   }
 }
 ```

The folder and files structure would look like this:

```
./
    branding.json
    /branding
        logo.png
        favicon.ico
        pwa-icon.svg
```

Finally run the command: `cht --url=<instance-url> upload-branding`

#### Using the admin interface

Log in to your instance and navigate to `Menu > App Settings > Images > Icons`

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
If your changes are not reflected on the browser, you will have to clear browser data to get rid of the already cached resources.

### 2. Partner logos

If you would like to display a collection of logos representing all of the organizations and funders involved in a project, there is a space for these at the bottom of the About page. This page can be accessed through; `Menu > About`

 {{< figure src="about_page.png" link="about_page.png" class="center col-6 col-lg-8" >}}

 #### Using cht-conf

Create a `partners.json` file if it doesn't exist. (This may have already been created by the initialise-project-layout command).
Edit the file with the following content:

```json
{
   "resources": {
     "partnerA": "parnerA.png",
     "partnerB": "parnerB.png",
     "partnerC": "parnerC.png"
   }
 }
 ```

 The folder and files structure would look like this:

```
./
    partners.json
    /partners
        parnerA.png
        parnerB.png
```

Finally run the command: `cht --url=<instance-url> upload-partners`

#### Using the admin interface

Log in to your instance and navigate to `Menu > App Settings > Images > Partners`

### 3. Header tab icons

As of cht-core 3.10, app header tabs icons are configurable. CHT currently has five tabs: messages, tasks, reports, contacts, analytics.

{{< see-also page="apps/reference/app-settings/header_tabs" title="Header tabs" >}}


#### Using cht-conf

Create a `app_settings.json` file if it doesn't exist. (This may have already been created by the initialise-project-layout command).

We will then add a `header_tabs` key within app_settings with the following structure:

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "icon": "fa-user"
  },
  "tasks": {
    "resource_icon": "medic-health-center"
  },
  "analytics": {
    "icon": "fa-flag",
    "resource_icon": "icon-treatment"
  },
  "reports": {
    "icon": "fa-list-alt"
  },
  "contacts": {
    "icon": "fa-user"
  }
}
```

The above assumes you have the following resource icons already in your instance (either uploaded or out-of-the-box): `medic-health-center`, `icon-treatment`.

Finally run the command: `cht --url=<instance-url> upload-app-settings`
{{< see-also page="apps/reference/resources" title="Icons" >}}

#### Using the admin interface

Log in to your instance and navigate to `Menu > App Settings > Images > Header Icons`

### 4. App Icons

Apps can be customised by defining the icons to use for tasks, targets, contacts or forms on the action bar.

Add icons to the `resources` folder, and include them by name in the `resources.json` file as the following example:

```json
 {
    "icon-risk": "icon-healthcare-warning@2x.png",
    "icon-treatment": "icon-healthcare-medicine@2x.png",
    "medic-clinic": "medic-family.svg",
    "medic-district-hospital": "medic-family.svg",
    "medic-health-center": "medic-chw-area.svg",
    "medic-person": "medic-person.svg"
 }
```

{{< see-also page="design/icons" title="Icon Library" >}}

The folder and files structure would look like this:

```
./
    resources.json
    /resources
        icon-healthcare-warning@2x.png
        icon-healthcare-medicine@2x.png
        medic-family.svg
        medic-family.svg
        medic-chw-area.svg
        medic-person.svg

```
Finally run the command: `cht --url=<instance-url> upload-resources`

To modify the icon used in contacts, you will need to edit the icon subkey in app_settings.json (under contact_types). You will modify app_settings.json with the following contents:

```json
{
  ...
  "contact_types": [
      {
        "id": "person",
        "name_key": "contact.type.person",
        "group_key": "contact.type.person.plural",
        "create_key": "contact.type.person.new",
        "edit_key": "contact.type.person.edit",
        "primary_contact_key": "person.field.contact",
        "icon": "medic-person",
        "create_form": "form:contact:person:create",
        "edit_form": "form:contact:person:edit"
      },
      ...
  ]
}
```

Finally run the command: `cht --local upload-app-settings`

To customise the icons used in tasks or the action bar, you will need to edit a form properties file and add an icon property as outline in [form properties]({{< ref "apps/tutorials/form-properties" >}}) tutorial.

To customise the icons used in targets, you will need to add an icon property in a target's definition as shown in the [targets]({{< ref "apps/tutorials/targets" >}}) tutorial.
