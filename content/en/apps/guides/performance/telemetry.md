_Introduced in v3.4.0_

The app collects performance data on certain user actions which is then aggregated over each calendar month and replicated to the server. This can be used to evaluate the performance of the code and configuration and to evaluate where improvements can be made.

The aggregate doc for the previous month is created when the first telemetry item is recorded each month. This is stored in the `medic-user-<username>-meta` database on the device and replicated to the server when an internet connection is available. This user specific server db is then replicated into the `medic-users-meta` database which holds all aggregate telemetry docs for all users.

The aggregate docs' IDs follow the pattern `telemetry-<year>-<month>-<username>-<uuid>`.

## Performance data

Each aggregate data point has the following fields.

| Field | Description |
|----|----|
| `sum` | A sum of all the recorded times in milliseconds. |
| `min` | The smallest time recorded in milliseconds. |
| `max` | The largest time recorded in milliseconds. |
| `count` | The number of times recorded. |
| `sumsqr` | The sum of squares of the times recorded in milliseconds. |

The telemetry data gathered changes with different versions of the framework. Currently, the data points collected are:

| Field | Description |
|----|----|
| `boot_time` | The overall boot time including loading the code, purging, and accessing the database. |
| `boot_time:1:to_first_code_execution` | The time between the page loading and the JavaScript starting to run. |
| `boot_time:2:to_bootstrap` | The time between JavaScript starting and the bootstrapping (purging, initial replication, etc) to complete. |
| `boot_time:3:to_angular_bootstrap` | The time between bootstrapping completing and the webapp being ready to use. |
| `boot_time:4:to_db_warmed` | The time between the webapp being ready to use and the database being ready to use. |
| `enketo:reports:<form>:<action>:<component>` | The time taken to fill in Enketo forms. The `action` can either be "add" or "edit". The `component` is one of: "render" covers getting the form and rendering it on screen; "user_edit_time" is the time the user took to fill in and submit the form; or "save" is about converting the form into a report and saving it. |
| `enketo:contacts:<form>:add:<component>` | As above but for Contact creation forms. |
| `enketo:tasks:<form>:<action>:<component>` | As above but for forms on the Tasks tab. |
| `search:contacts` | The time taken to list all contacts. |
| `search:contacts:<filter[:filter]>` | The time taken to search all contacts using the given filters. |
| `search:reports` | The time taken to list all reports. |
| `search:reports:<filter[:filter]>` | The time taken to search all reports using the given filters. |
| `client-date-offset` | The difference between the client datetime and the server datetime. Only recorded if the difference is large enough that it may cause issues. |
| `analytics:targets:load` | The time taken to load the targets page. Added in 3.9 | 
| `tasks:load` | The time taken to load the tasks page. Added in 3.9 | 
| `tasks:refresh` | The time taken to refresh tasks on the tasks page. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:initialize` | The time taken to initialize the rules-engine . Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:update-emissions` | The time taken to update emissions in the rules-engine, when receiving a change. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:tasks:all-contacts` | The time taken to fetch tasks for all contacts in rules-engine. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:tasks:some-contacts` | The time taken to fetch tasks for some specific contacts in rules-engine. Added in 3.9 |
| `rules-engine:targets` | Time taken for the rules-engine to fetch targets. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:targets:dirty-contacts` | Number of "dirty" contacts[1] when fetching targets in the rules-engine. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:tasks:dirty-contacts` | Number of "dirty" contacts[1] when fetching tasks in the rules-engine. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:ensureTaskFreshness:cancel` | The time taken to cancel the automated task freshness thread in the rules-engine. This event is only recorded when the thread is cancelled before executing the refresh. Added in 3.9 | 
| `rules-engine:ensureTargetFreshness:cancel` | The time taken to cancel the automated target freshness thread in the rules-engine. This event is only recorded when the thread is cancelled before executing the refresh. Added in 3.9 |
    
[1] "Dirty" indicates that the contact's task documents are not up to date. They will be refreshed before being used.
