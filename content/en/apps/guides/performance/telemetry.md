  Performance data of certain user actions

_Introduced in v3.4.0_

The app collects performance data on certain user actions which is then aggregated each day and replicated to the server. This can be used to evaluate the performance of the code and configuration and to evaluate where improvements can be made.

The aggregate doc for the previous day is created when the first telemetry item is recorded each day. This is stored in the `medic-user-<username>-meta` database on the device and replicated to the server when an internet connection is available. This user specific server db is then replicated into the `medic-users-meta` database which holds all aggregate telemetry docs for all users.

The aggregate docs' IDs follow the pattern `telemetry-<year>-<month>-<day>-<username>-<uuid>`.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Versions prior to v3.12.0 do aggregate in a monthly basis instead of daily, and the aggregate docs' IDs follow the pattern `telemetry-<year>-<month>-<username>-<uuid>`.

## Performance data

Each aggregate data point has the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|----|----|
| `sum` | A sum of all the recorded times in milliseconds. |
| `min` | The smallest time recorded in milliseconds. |
| `max` | The largest time recorded in milliseconds. |
| `count` | The number of times recorded. |
| `sumsqr` | The sum of squares of the times recorded in milliseconds. This is useful to see the variance, for example, a lower sumsqr can be indicative of having data closer together. |

The CHT records the Apdex (Application Performance Index) that is an open standard for measuring performance of software applications. Its purpose is to convert measurements into insights about user satisfaction, by specifying a uniform way to analyze and report on the degree to which measured performance meets user expectations. 

The Apdex level is `satisfied` when the duration is less than or equal to 3s; `tolerable` when the duration is more than 3s but less than or equal to 12s; `frustrated` when duration is more than 12s. The Apdex is recorded as a telemetry entry using the format: `<telemetry_field>:apdex:<satisfied/tolerable/frustrated>`, for example, if the telemetry is about boot time and it had a tolerable performance, the Apdex is recorded as `boot_time:apdex:tolerable`.

## Export data to JSON

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Telemetry data can be viewed directly in your browser with [Fauxton](https://couchdb.apache.org/fauxton-visual-guide/) at `https://{{CHT_INSTANCE_URL}}/_utils`, and navigating the `medic-users-meta` database.
{{% /alert %}}

To export all telemetry in JSON for further analysis or visualization, first meet these prerequisites:

1. Ensure that both [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) are installed and that the needed `node` libraries are installed: `npm install inquirer pouchdb-core fs path minimist pouchdb-adapter-http`
1. Get a current copy of the export script: `curl -s -o get_users_meta_docs.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/medic/cht-core/master/scripts/get_users_meta_docs.js` 

To export the data open a terminal in the folder where you want to save the export, and run this command:
 
```bash
node get_users_meta_docs.js --mode batch --type telemetry https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@COUCHDB_SERVER:COUCHDB_PORT/medic-users-meta > telemetry.json
``` 

For example, if your username is `admin`, your password is `pass`, your CouchDB server is `localhost` and your CouchDB port is `5984`, you would run: 

```bash
node get_users_meta_docs.js --mode batch --type telemetry https://admin:pass@localhost:5984/medic-users-meta > telemetry.json
```

This will save a file named `telemetry.json` containing all the telemetry data in the current directory.
