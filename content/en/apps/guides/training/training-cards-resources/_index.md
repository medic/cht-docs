## Best practices

If you are deploying new training cards, here are some best practices to follow: 

- When deploying training cards for the first time, provide guidance in advance as to what users should expect from the cards and how to use them
- Test training card content with a small set of users to ensure learnability and understanding before deploying to your live instance
- Test on a physical device to see what content will look like on different screen sizes
- Keep content to a minimum and try to have as few cards as possible
- Ensure images aren't confused with UI elements: Add outlines or shadows indicating they're for demonstrative purposes only. Never include navigation buttons in your screenshots (e.g., "Next" or "Cancel").
- Make sure users know who to contact if they run into issues
- Establish success criteria for the training cards

Some examples of data to monitor include:

- Users who have completed the training within X days
- Outliers, ex. users who have seen the cards multiple times and not completed the training
- The intended users have received the training

## Examples
