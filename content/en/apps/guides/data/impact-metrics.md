Impact monitoring is an essential part of both the Community Health Toolkit and Medic Mobile's processes and ethos. We are committed to harnessing data to: 

1. Support our partners in data-driven operational and strategic decision making
2. Inform our product roadmap and organizational strategy, and 
3. Participate in overarching policy discussions around community health. 

As a member of the CHT community and potential CHT implementer, we encourage you to learn more about the recommended impact metrics for monitoring and evaluation across priority use cases by reviewing the metrics listed below.
