In order to implement the Medic Mobile Standard package at your site, you will require an Android device for the Medic gateway. You may use an existing Android device and are not required to purchase a new one. However, please note that the Android device must always stay in your organizationâ€™s office or facility, and must be connected to stable and continuous internet at all times.

Below is a list of recommended Android devices across a range of prices. You may find these in local mobile equipment stores as well as online through Amazon and other e-commerce sites. 

## Low-cost devices:
- LG L60 *
- Samsung Duos *
- Lenovo A1000

## Medium-cost devices:
- Samsung Galaxy J5 *
- Huawei Honor 4x *
- Huawei G Play mini *
- Motorola Moto X play

## High-cost devices:

*Devices marked with an asterisk have been tested and used by Medic Mobile and our partners before.

Android OS: We also support Android version 4.1 (Jelly Beans) and above. Details of the Android history can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history). 

We highly recommend investing in devices that are medium to high-cost, and in models that are marked with an asterisk in the list above to ensure optimal efficiency.
