As of v3.6.0, SMS messages can be sent and received using the [Africa's Talking](https://africastalking.com) service.

## Africa's Talking configuration

First generate a long unique key to use as the `cht-api-key`.

Log on to the [Africa's Talking Dashboard](https://account.africastalking.com) and configure your callback URLs as follows.

- Delivery Reports: `https://<hostname>/api/v1/sms/africastalking/delivery-reports?key=<cht-api-key>`
- Incoming Messages: `https://<hostname>/api/v1/sms/africastalking/incoming-messages?key=<cht-api-key>`

Then generate an "API Key" (we'll refer to this as the `at-api-key`) and save this in your CHT Core configuration covered below.

## CHT Core configuration

### API keys

The Africa's Talking integration uses the CHT Credentials service to retrieve the API keys using the IDs `africastalking.com:incoming` and `africastalking.com:outgoing`. Use the [CHT credentials API](/apps/reference/api#put-apiv1credentials) to securely store the credentials.

### App settings

Update your app settings as follows.

```json
{
  "sms": {
    "outgoing_service": "africas-talking",
    "reply_to": "<africa's talking shortcode>",
    "africas_talking": {
      "username": "<africa's talking username>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

To test your integration, set your "username" to "sandbox", log in to [Africa's Talking](https://account.africastalking.com), and go to the Sandbox app.
