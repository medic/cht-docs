In order to use SMS workflows with the CHT you will need an SMS gateway. For reliability an SMS Aggregator, such as [Africa's Talking]({{< ref "apps/guides/messaging/gateways/africas-talking" >}}) or [RapidPro]({{< ref "apps/guides/messaging/gateways/rapidpro" >}}), is recommended. When an SMS Aggregator is not available, an Android device running [CHT Gateway](https://github.com/medic/cht-gateway) can be used to send and receive SMS in your CHT application. You may use an existing Android device and are not required to purchase a new one. However, for more reliable sending and receiving of SMS, the Android device should be in your organizationâ€™s office or facility with a consistent internet connection.
