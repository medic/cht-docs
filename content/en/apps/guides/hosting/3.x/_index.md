To get an overview on how these hosting solutions use `docker` and `docker-compose`, as well as other key CHT concepts, be sure to read the [guide on a Local Setup]({{< relref "apps/tutorials/local-setup" >}}). Note that while this is for CHT 4.x, the concepts apply to 3.x.

Before beginning any of these guides, be sure to meet all of the [CHT hosting requirements]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/requirements" >}}) first.

To host a production instance of CHT, use either the [AWS]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/3.x/ec2-setup-guide" >}}) or [Self]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/3.x/self-hosting" >}}) hosting guides. To do app development, see our [App Developer]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/3.x/app-developer" >}}) hosting guide.

To view 4.x hosting options, see the  [4.x hosting section]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/4.x" >}})
