{{% alert title="Note" %}} To get an overview on how these hosting solutions use `docker` and `docker-compose`, as well as other key CHT concepts, be sure to read the [guide on a Local Setup]({{< relref "apps/tutorials/local-setup" >}}). {{% /alert %}}

Before beginning any of these guides, be sure to meet all of the [CHT hosting requirements]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/requirements" >}}) first.

To host a production instance of CHT, use the [Self Hosting in CHT 4.x]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/4.x/self-hosting" >}}) guide. To do app development, see our [App Developer]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/4.x/app-developer" >}}) hosting guide.

To view 3.x hosting options, see the  [3.x hosting section]({{< relref "apps/guides/hosting/3.x" >}})
