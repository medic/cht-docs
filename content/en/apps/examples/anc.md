This "reference application" for maternal and newborn health provides a template for structuring and organizing your Community Health Toolkit digital health app, its configuration, and test code. It can be used as is, or serve as a great way to learn about the CHT's foundation for forms, data fields, and analytics that can be easily customized to fit your context.

## Problem Being Addressed

Access to quality maternal and newborn care is the cornerstone of many community health programs. For many women living in communities at the last mile, pregnancy can be a [vulnerable time](https://www.who.int/health-topics/maternal-health). There is a need for community health programs to support early pregnancy registration, consistent antenatal care (ANC) visits, and in-facility deliveries. In addition, the short time window following delivery for postnatal care (PNC) is a critical time for catching life-threatening danger signs for the new mother and baby. 

## Solution Overview

The maternal and newborn health workflow ensures that women receive the care that they need during their pregnancy with the support of CHWs. Early pregnancy registration, timely antenatal care visits, and improved care coordination between CHWs and clinics increase the likelihood that women will deliver in a facility with the support of skilled birth attendants. This ultimately will help save the lives of mothers and babies, as well as strengthen the maternal and newborn health services of the health system. Community Health Toolkit applications with maternal and newborn workflows are used by health workers and clinical staff to:

- Register pregnancies
- Provide a schedule for on-time ANC visits
- Offer education for the mother at each stage of pregnancy
- Screen for and report danger signs in the pregnant woman and newborn
- Refer and encourage pregnant women to deliver at a facility 
- Ensure on-time PNC visits for mother and newborn

## Forms Hierarchy

Once a [hierarchy]({{< relref "apps/concepts/hierarchy" >}}) of people and places is established, forms are added at different levels. This diagram indicates the forms that can be filled about a person in the app (in this case, family members at the household level), as well as the person/user who will access these forms and make the reports (CHWs at the CHW Area level). Some forms are accessible as actions from the family member’s profile as actions, others from the CHW’s task list as tasks, and some as either.

## Workflows

Both maternal and newborn care workflows are defined to connect form actions and data with people. Detailed documentation for these forms and task schedules are linked from the workflow diagrams below. Accompanying this documentation are tips and insights into the design decisions made along the way, and suggestions for how and where to customize the forms.
