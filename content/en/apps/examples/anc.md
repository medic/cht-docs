CHT applications are configurable by design and support an exceptional range of features and health service areas. The ANC Reference App provides organizations with a template for structuring and organizing you app, itâ€™s configuration code, and testing framework. It includes a foundation for forms related to pregnancy and delivery, flexible data fields, and even analytics, and can be deployed as-is or customized by a developer for your unique context.
