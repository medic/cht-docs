The CHTâ€™s Contact Tracing functionality enables effective surveillance of individuals to help control infectious disease outbreaks. It is a community public health tool that is designed to: 

* Centrally register and track contacts to prevent secondary spread of diseases in communities
* Create a coordinated approach to contact tracing within existing health system structures
* Communicate the importance of self-isolation and symptom screening to exposed contacts

## Problem Being Addressed

An essential part of containing outbreaks of viruses, like COVID-19, requires public health organizations to rapidly notify people who have come into contact with someone who has tested positive. Traditional health systems and medical records technologies are ill equipped to handle the necessary tracking and care referrals for large numbers of patients to prevent secondary spread of viruses.

## Solution Overview

Contact Tracing with the CHT offers a rapidly scalable outbreak prevention strategy by registering patient cases and their contacts within communities in a responsive and empathetic way. Through proactive tracing of contacts, active symptoms screening, and referrals to care or self-isolation, the app can be deployed to assist in: 

* Disrupting secondary transmission via coordinated registration of patient cases
* Engaging in community education and follow-up
* Enrolling all contacts and households in monitoring during isolation periods
* Referring symptomatic cases for skilled care following triage

## App Workflow Example

This is a detailed workflow that supports tracing of contacts of suspected cases, symptom screening, care referrals, and monitoring of asymptomatic contacts during self-isolation. It works on both SMS and the CHT app. It can be combined with other care workflows and configured to suit specific health system needs, particularly in terms of tracer roles.
