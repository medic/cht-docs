Since 2017, [Partners in Health (PIH) Malawi](https://www.pih.org/country/malawi) and [Medic](https://medic.org/) have collaboratively co-designed and developed YendaNafe app, a digital health app for community based service provision. In the spirit of openness, Medic and PIH have coordinated the release of full application source code of Yendanafe app as first of kind "Integrated CHT Reference app". This Reference app provides an example that CHT Implementers can learn how they can design and configure integrated workflows.

## Problem being addressed
Malawi is one of the countries with a high prevalence of HIV with about 1 million people currently living with HIV, high rates of infant and maternal mortality and a high burden of non communicable diseases. To help respond to community needs and reduce the disease burden, PIH in partnership with the Ministry of Health are implementing an integrated household model in Neno District. Under the model, community health workers (CHWs) and CHW supervisors have been equipped with the YendaNafe app, the app supports the health care workers to provide integrated community based health care services and to coordinate care.

## Solution overview
The YendaNafe app workflows support CHWs to conduct integrated disease screening, provide health care services, refer people in communities to facilities especially those who require facility based care and raise community awareness on health. The app is designed to support the following key health areas:
* Maternal child health (antenatal care and postnatal care)
* Family planning
* Malnutrition
* Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)
* Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
* Tuberculosis (TB)
* Non communicable diseases

## Workflows
### Maternal neonatal health workflow
This workflow consists of the pregnancy, delivery and postnatal workflows.

#### Pregnancy workflow

#### Delivery workflow

#### Postnatal workflow
{{< figure src="post_natal_workflow.png"  link="post_natal_workflow.png" alt="post natal workflow" title="" class="left col-12">}}

### Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) workflow
This workflow is designed to support CHWs to identify symptomatic children at the household level, guide CHW through the IMCI protocol during the provision of care and enable the CHWs to conduct on-time follow ups for children through the follow up tasks

#### IMCI workflow

### Malnutrition workflow
The workflow supports CHWs to assess and identify malnourished children and refer malnourished children to a health facility.

#### Malnutrition workflow

### Family planning workflow
The FP workflow ensures that eligible women receive their FP needs with support from the CHWs. The FP workflow supports CHWs to counsel eligible women on FP, refer women to facilities for FP services and ensure ontime FP renewals.

#### Family planning workflow

### TB workflows
The TB workflow enables CHWs to screen patients for TB, follow up TB patients and refer suspected TB cases to senior CHW for sputum collection. Senior CHWs who are based at the community level submits the sputum collection form after collecting the sputum samples for TB testing and the Senior CHWs who are based at the facility level supports in notifying CHWs when the TB results are out and in tracing TB defaulters..

#### TB workflow for TB suspected cases identified in a community setting.

#### TB workflow for TB cases screened in a facility setting and TB defaulters

### Non communicable diseases workflow
The non communicable diseases workflows support health care workers to screen for NCD symptoms, refer suspected cases to facilities and trace clients who have defaulted treatment.

### Human Immunodeficiency Virus workflow
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) workflow is designed to guide CHWs in HIV screening of household members, screening for side effects for persons on antiretroviral treatment and CHWs can use the workflows to trace defaulters who are on ART treatment.

## Resources to Get Started

Here are a few additional resources to help get you started with the maternal and newborn health reference application.

- View the [configuration code for this reference app](https://github.com/medic/cht-pih-malawi-app)
- Install the reference app following these [easy installation instructions]({{< ref "apps/tutorials/local-setup" >}})
- Modify the maternal and newborn reference application for your project context using [configuration best practices]({{< ref "design/best-practices" >}})

The open sharing of digital health apps used by CHWs is a monumental milestone in the digital health space, and for the CHT Community. Reach out on the [forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/) to share how you will leverage these resources, along with your feedback and continued innovations that could benefit the larger community.
