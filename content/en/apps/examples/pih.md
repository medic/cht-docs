Since 2017, [Partners in Health (PIH) Malawi](https://www.pih.org/country/malawi) and [Medic](https://medic.org/) have collaboratively co-designed and developed YendaNafe, a digital health app for community based service provision. In the spirit of openness, Medic and PIH have coordinated the release of the full application source code of Yendanafe app as first of kind ‘‘Integrated CHT Reference app’’. This Reference app provides an example that CHT Implementers can learn how they can design and configure integrated workflows.

## Problem being addressed
Malawi is one of the countries with a high prevalence of HIV, high rates of infant and maternal mortality and a high burden of non communicable diseases (NCD) and tuberculosis. To help respond to community needs and reduce the disease burden, PIH in partnership with the Ministry of Health are implementing an integrated household model in Neno District. Under the model, community health workers (CHWs) and CHW supervisors have been equipped with the YendaNafe app, the app supports the health care workers to provide integrated community based health care services and to coordinate care.


## Solution overview
The YendaNafe app workflows support CHWs to conduct integrated disease screening, provide health care services, refer people in communities to facilities especially those who require facility based care and raise community awareness on health. The app is designed to support the following key health areas:

* Maternal child health (antenatal care and postnatal care)
* Family planning (FP)
* Malnutrition
* Immunization
* Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)
* Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
* Tuberculosis (TB)
* Non communicable diseases (NCDs)

## Workflows
### Maternal neonatal health workflow
This workflow consists of the pregnancy, delivery and postnatal workflows.The pregnancy workflow enables CHWs to register new pregnancies, screen pregnant mothers for danger signs and follow up pregnant mother to remind them to attend the scheduled ANC clinic appointments. The postnatal (PNC) workflow supports CHWs to follow up PNC women and newborns for danger signs screening and refer PNC women with danger signs to facilities to receive more care.

### TB workflows
The TB workflow enables CHWs to screen patients for TB, refer suspected TB cases to senior CHW for sputum collection and follow up TB patients. Senior CHWs who are based at the community level submit the sputum collection form after collecting the sputum samples for TB testing and the Site supervisors who are based at the facility level support in notifying CHWs when the TB results are out and in tracing TB defaulters.
