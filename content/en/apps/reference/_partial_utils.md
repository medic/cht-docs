Utility functions in the Core Framework can make common tasks much easier. These are available only for Tasks and Targets. To use the function call `Utils.<function-name>(<params>)`, for example `Utils.addDate(report.reported_date, 10)`.

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `isTimely(date, event)` | Returns true if the given date is after the start date and before the end date of the event. |
| `addDate(date, days)` | Returns a new Date set to midnight the given number of days after the given date. If no date is given the date defaults to today. |
| `getLmpDate(doc)` | Attempts to work out the LMP from the given doc. If no LMP is given it defaults to four weeks before the reported_date. |
| `getSchedule(name)` | Returns the task schedule with the given name from the configuration. |
| `getMostRecentTimestamp(reports, form)` | Returns the reported_date of the most recent of the reports with form ID matching the given form. |
| `getMostRecentReport(reports, form)` | Like `getMostRecentTimestamp` but returns the report, not just the reported_date. |
| `isFormSubmittedInWindow(reports, form, start, end)` | Returns true if any of the given reports are for the given form and were reported after start and before end. |
| `isFirstReportNewer(firstReport, secondReport)` | Returns true if the firstReport was reported before the secondReport. |
| `isDateValid(date)` | Returns true if the given date is a validate JavaScript Date. |
| `now()` | Returns the current Date. |
| `MS_IN_DAY` | A constant for the number of milliseconds in a day. |

Please open [an issue](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/new) if you'd like other functions included.

Custom functions and variables can be written in [`nools-extra.js`]({{< ref "apps/reference/nools-extras" >}}), which is accessible to both Targets and Tasks.
