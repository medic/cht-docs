Permissions are defined by the `permissions` object in the `base_settings.json` file. The list below illustrates the available system defined permissions. To utilize a permission, you will need to first add the permission as a property of the `permissions` object, and then associate the permission to user role(s).

Permissions can be assigned to user roles either directly in `base_settings.json` as an array of user role identifiers, or configured in the App Management app.
