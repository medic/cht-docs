## Summary of Page Tabs

{{< figure src="page-tabs.png" link="page-tabs.png" class="right col-6 col-lg-3" >}}

Page tabs are the primary way to navigate apps built with the Core Framework. The number of tabs is variable depending on the user’s role and place in the hierarchy. For example, non-admin users don’t have Messages. The Reports tab is accessible to CHWs but often located inside the secondary menu drawer.
- **People​**: This is where profiles of districts, staff, CHWs and patients live
- **Tasks​**: This is a list of upcoming visits, follow-ups, or other required tasks
- **Targets**: Displays real-time visualizations of key activity and impact indicators
- **Reports​**: A detailed history of all forms submitted by CHWs and other staff
- **Messages​**: A place for community-based staff to send and exchange messages

## Sync Status

At the bottom of the menu is a notification which provides important about sync status. It lets you know whether reports are being submitted.

If the sync status is green and says “All reports synced,” your reports have been sent. This means you have successfully uploaded all of your data to the server. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have downloaded all of the most recent data from the server.

If the indicator is red, it means there are still reports waiting to send. This means you have not successfully uploaded all of your  data to the server. You should check your internet and data connection.
