## Summary of Page Tabs

{{< figure src="page-tabs.png" link="page-tabs.png" class="right col-6 col-lg-3" >}}

Page tabs are the primary way to navigate apps built with the Core Framework. The number of tabs is variable depending on the user’s role and place in the hierarchy. For example, non-admin users don’t have Messages. The Reports tab is accessible to CHWs but often located inside the secondary menu drawer.
- **People​**: This is where profiles of districts, staff, CHWs and patients live
- **Tasks​**: This is a list of upcoming visits, follow-ups, or other required tasks
- **Targets**: Displays real-time visualizations of key activity and impact indicators
- **Reports​**: A detailed history of all forms submitted by CHWs and other staff
- **Messages​**: A place for community-based staff to send and exchange messages

### Sync Status

{{< figure src="sync-status.png" link="sync-status.png" class="right col-6 col-lg-3" >}}

Data synchronisation is important for [offline users]({{ ref="users" }}). These users keep a copy of the data they have access to on their device. They can work from their device while disconnected from the internet (offline), by reading from and writing to their copy of the data. "Sync" (synchronisation) is when data on the device is made to match the data on the server. Synchronisation consists of uploading all new or altered data on the device, and downloading new or altered data from the server. This may include the download of software updates when available.

At the bottom of the menu is a notification which provides important information about data synchronisation.

If the sync status is green and says “All reports synced,” this means you have successfully uploaded the most recent data on your device to the server. It also means that you downloaded the latest data from the server as of the time displayed. Note that there could be more recent data changes on the server, and it doesn't guarantee you are up to date.

If the indicator is red, it means you have data changes waiting to be uploaded to the server. You should check your internet and data connection to ensure a successful sync.
