*Interoperability* and *Integration* are often used interchangeably but mean different things. [This](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lets-talk-interoperability-vs-integration-mike-fleck) article offers a useful delineation between the two.

>With **interoperability**, systems work together, even if they werenâ€™t designed specifically to work together, because standard communication protocol techniques are applied. Two (or more) systems that weren't designed to be interoperable require **integration**.

[OpenHIE](https://ohie.org/), [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html), [ICD-10](https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/factsheet/en/), [LOINC](https://loinc.org/), etc... are examples of healthcare related protocols and standards used to achieve interoperability. CHT Core can be configured to support many of these standards and also exchange data with other systems through *integrations*.
