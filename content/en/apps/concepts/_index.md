  Basic concepts that will help you understand how CHT applications are built
---

Applications built with CHT Core support health workers with their activities in their community. Health workers are guided through tasks — such as screening for high-risk pregnancies or diagnosing and providing treatments for children — and get real-time indicators for progress towards their goals. These workflows are highly flexible and developed using a combination of JavaScript, JSON, and XForms.

The JavaScript and JSON portions allow for full control of tasks, targets, and contact profiles, as well as other application settings. The XForms portion extends the ODK XForm notation, and is used to define forms. Forms allow CHWs to register new families and people. Forms also allow CHWs to complete surveys, care guides, and decision support, eg when assessing a sick child, or registering a new pregnancy for antenatal care schedule. Forms can live in many parts of the app including the Tasks, People, and Reports pages.
