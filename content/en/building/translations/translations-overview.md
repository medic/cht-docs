  Adding language translations in the CHT
---

Given that CHT apps are used around the world, the Core Framework was designed with localization in mind. The Core Framework itself is available in English, French, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish, Swahili, and Indonesian.

## Brief Overview of Key Concepts

*Localization* refers to setting up the desired language in CHT for the end user.

*Translations* refers to manually setting up extra translations of instance tabs texts or outgoing SMS text. See an outline of how to do that [in the dedicated section]({{< ref "building/translations/localizing-translations#translations" >}}).

## Required Resources

You should have a functioning [CHT instance with `cht-conf` installed locally]({{< ref "building/local-setup" >}}), completed a [project folder]({{< ref "building/local-setup#3-create-and-upload-a-blank-project" >}}) setup, and an [messages-sw.properties]({{< ref "building/translations/localizing-translations" >}}) file.
