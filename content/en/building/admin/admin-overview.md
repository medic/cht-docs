  Overview of the App Management
---

*App Management* is an interface for non-technical administrative users. With it you can manage users and make minor changes to the app, such as setting the SMS gateway phone number, and changing the default language for the app.

The **App Management** pages are a desktop-only interface meant for users with a reliable internet connection.
