### Admin Console vs Command Line Tools

In general, everything that can be done in the **Admin Console** can also be done in command line tools, but not everything in the command line tools can be done in the **Admin Console**.

The **Admin Console** does not track changes. For most app development, using command line tools such as cht-conf and tracking files using a version control system is recommended

**In Admin Console But Not Command Line Tools:**
- User management
- ~Upgrades~

**In Command Line Tools But Not Admin Console:**
- Most of the JSON settings
- XLS â†’ Xform conversion
