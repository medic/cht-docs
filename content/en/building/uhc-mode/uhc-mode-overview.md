> [!IMPORTANT]
> CHT apps using the _UHC Mode_ empower CHWs to provide equitable and timely care to families in their catchment area. This feature was [codeveloped with Muso](https://www.musohealth.org/post/new-study-demonstrates-how-digital-health-tools-can-enable-progress-towards-universal-health-care), and showed an increase in household coverage for both rural and peri-urban settings, thereby increasing the effectiveness of CHWs and improving access to care for the populations they serve.

A Muso study in collaboration with Medic, [showed an increase in household coverage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXruezV7sCo-CtJfi8WDivzgMcKZNdXM/view): 

> UHC Mode should be considered an effective tool that can improve minimum expected home visit coverage and promote progress towards UHC when implemented in the proactive community case management context.
