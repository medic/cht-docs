The _UHC Mode_ in the CHT allows health workers to see when a household within their care area was last visited, and prioritize visits accordingly.

When using the _UHC Mode_, the households in the contact list can be sorted by when they were last visited. The days since the last visit is also shown in the app, along with the number of visits made to a household in a month period.
