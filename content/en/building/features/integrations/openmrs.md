[OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org) is an open source electronic medical record system used in dozens of countries. Integrating CHT apps with OpenMRS can open up opportunities to improve health outcomes for patients by promoting better coordination of care. For example, referrals by CHWs in the community can be sent electronically to health facilities using OpenMRS so that nurses and clinicians can prepare for their visit and have full access to the assessment done by a CHW.

Integrating CHT apps with OpenMRS can be achieved by following the CHT's [OpenMRS integration guide]({{< ref "building/integrations/openmrs" >}}), which leverages the [OpenMRS REST API](https://rest.openmrs.org).
