The Community Health Toolkit (CHT) is highly configurable and can be customized to support multiple hierarchies and users in the health care system. The CHT user management tool is a user friendly web application that works with the CHT to decentralize the user management process to the subnational levels, increasing efficiency and accuracy. This guide highlights steps for setting up and configuring the user management tool. 
The guide has been tailored for specific CHT-supported national community health information systems. Partners and ministries of health are advised to customize the tool to fit their specific needs.
The tool provides templates that can be downloaded and populated.

The user management tool has various features and fuctionalities including:
* Creation of single or bulk (many) users.
* Replacing of existing users
* Moving of an existing place
  * Users can access bulk user templates that they can populate.
  * One can validate the entries before the upload.
  * Download the user credentials upon upload.
* Validation of input for completeness and accuracy. The tool identifies errors that the can be corrected.

# Configuring the CHT User Management tool
## Implementation Steps
1. Clone the `cht-user-management` repository.
2. Create a new folder under `src/config` with your required instance eg. chis-znz
3. Within that new folder create a `config.json` file with the following parameters
   Property | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
`domains` | Array | Controls the list of instances which the user can login to
`domains.friendly` | string | Friendly name for the instance (eg. "Migori")
`domains.domain` | string | Hostname for the instance (eg. "migori-echis.health.go.ke")
`domains.useHttp` | boolean | Whether to make an insecure connection (http) to the hostname (defaults to false)
`contact_types` | Array | One element for each type of user which can be created by the system
`contact_types.name` | string | The name of the contact_type as it [appears in the app's base_settings.json](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/hierarchy/)
`contact_types.friendly` | string | Friendly name of the contact type
`contact_types.contact_type` | string | The contact_type of the primary contact. [As defined in base_settings.json](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/hierarchy/)
`contact_types.contact_friendly` | string | Friendly name of the primary contact type
`contact_types.user_role` | string[] | A list of allowed [user roles](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/app-settings/user-roles/). If only one is provided, it will be used by default.
`contact_types.username_from_place` | boolean | When true, the username is generated from the place's name. When false, the username is generated from the primary contact's name. Default is false.
`contact_types.hierarchy` | Array<ConfigProperty> | Defines how this `contact_type` is connected into the hierarchy. An element with `level:1` (parent) is required and additional elements can be provided to support disambiguation. See [ConfigProperty](#configproperty).
`contact_types.hierarchy.level` | integer | The hierarchy element with `level:1` is the parent, `level:3` is the great grandparent.
`contact_types.replacement_property` | Property | Defines how this `contact_type` is described when being replaced. The `property_name` is always `replacement`. See [ConfigProperty](#configproperty).
`contact_types.place_properties` | Array<ConfigProperty> | Defines the attributes which are collected and set on the user's created place. See [ConfigProperty](#configproperty).
`contact_types.contact_properties` | Array<ConfigProperty> | Defines the attributes which are collected and set on the user's primary contact doc. See [ConfigProperty](#configproperty).
`contact_types.deactivate_users_on_replace` | boolean | Controls what should happen to the defunct contact and user documents when a user is replaced. When `false`, the contact and user account will be deleted. When `true`, the contact will be unaltered and the user account will be assigned the role `deactivated`. This allows for account restoration.
`logoBase64` | Image in base64 | Logo image for your project

4. Add reference to your configuration folder(that you have just added above) in `src/config/config-factory.ts`. For example `import znzConfig from './chis-znz'`
5. Configure the `config.json` file.

#### ConfigProperty
The ConfigProperty is a data structure used several times within the `config.json` file and defines a property on an object. The ConfigProperty include:

Property | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
friendly_name | string | Defines how this data will be labeled in CSV files and throughout the user experience.
property_name | string | Defines how the value will be stored on the object.
type | ConfigPropertyType | Defines the validation rules, and auto-formatting rules. See [ConfigPropertyType](#configpropertytype).
parameter | any | See [ConfigPropertyType](#configpropertytype).
required | boolean | True if the object should not exist without this information.

#### ConfigPropertyType
The `ConfigPropertyType` defines a property's validation rules and auto-formatting rules. The optional `parameter` information alters the behavior of the `ConfigPropertyType`.

| Type      | Validation Rules                                       | Auto Formatting Rules                                               | Validator                                                                                              | Parameter     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| string    | Must be defined                                        | Removes double whitespaces, leading or trailing whitespaces, and any character which is not alphanumeric or ` ()\-'` | None                                                                                                   |

| generated | None. No user inputs.                                  | Uses [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) templates to generate data    | None                                                                                                   | [Details](#the-generated-configpropertytype)
| select_one      | Single choice from a list of options            | Same as `string`                                                                                               | None                                                                                                   | Dictionary where the keys are the option values and the values are the corresponding labels |

| none      | None                                                   | None                                                                | None                                                                                                   |

#### The Generated ConfigPropertyType
ContactProperties with `type: "generated"` use the [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) template engine to populate a property with data. Here is an example of some configuration properties which use `"type": "generated"`:

```json
{
  "place_properties": [
    {
      "friendly_name": "CHP Area Name",
      "property_name": "name",
      "type": "generated",
      "parameter": "{{ contact.name }}'s Area",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "contact_properties": [
    {
      "friendly_name": "CHP Name",
      "property_name": "name",
      "type": "name",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The user will be prompted to input the contact's name (CHP Name). The user is _not_ prompted to input the place's name (CHP Area Name) because the place's name will automatically be assigned a value.  In this example, if the user puts `john` as the contact's name, then the place will be named `John's Area`.

The data that is passed to the template is consistent with the properties defined in your configuration.

Variable | Value
-- | --
place | Has the attributes from `place_properties.property_name` 
contact | Has the attributes from `contact_properties.property_name`
lineage | Has the attributes from `hierarchy.property_name` 

### Deployment
This tool is available via Docker by running `docker compose up`. Set the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

## Development
Create an environment file by `cp env.example .env`. Change `INTERFACE` to `127.0.0.1` and otherwise see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more info.

Then run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

or

```shell
npm run build
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

The `env.example` file has example values.  Here's what they mean:

Variable | Description | Sample
-- | -- | --
`CONFIG_NAME` | Name of the configuration to use | `chis-ke`
`EXTERNAL_PORT` | Port to use in docker compose when starting the web server | `3000`
`PORT` | For localhost development environment | `3000`
`COOKIE_PRIVATE_KEY` | A string used to two-way encryption of cookies. Production values need to be a secret. Suggest `uuidgen` to generate | `589a7f23-5bb2-4b77-ac78-f202b9b6d5e3`
`INTERFACE` | Interface to bind to. Leave as '0.0.0.0' for prod, suggest '127.0.0.1' for development | `127.0.0.1`
