## Upgrade notes

### Breaking changes

None.

### UI/UX changes

#### New dialog showing sync status

When an offline user manually triggers a sync via the hamburger menu, a notification dialog is opened indicating the status of the sync process.

Sync in progress:

Sync complete:

Sync failed (with retry option):

[#5207](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/5207): Show dialog when user clicks "Sync Now" in hamburger menu

#### Updated icon for the Create Report button

The icon for the Create Report button has been updated so that its purpose is more clear.

[#6403](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6403): Change the Create Report button icon to better indicate what it does

#### Display all dates in Bikram Sambat format when Nepali locale selected

For years, the CHT has supported recording the answers to `date` questions in forms using the [Bikram Sambat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Samvat) calendar format when the user has selected the Nepali locale. However, the date values displayed throughout the app would still be shown in the [Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) calendar format.

Now the application has been updated to also use the Bikram Sambat format when displaying dates in places such as the reports list.

Old Dates | New Dates
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](../images/3.14.0-7294-old.png)  |  ![](../images/3.14.0-7294-new.png)

Additionally, a new [`to-bikram-sambat` xPath function]({{< ref "building/forms/app#to-bikram-sambat" >}}) has been added that converts a `date` to a `string` containing the value of the date in the Bikram Sambat format.  

[#7294](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7294): Use Bikram Sambat dates throughout the webapp when Nepali locale selected

#### Properly display tab labels on small screens

Previously, the labels for the main tabs in the CHT app (Messages, Tasks, People, etc) were not displayed on devices with very small screens leading to some confusion around the different tabs and their purposes.

We have updated the tab labels to always display even on small screens. Additionally the size of the label text can scale so that the text will display properly even when the tabs are small.

[#7409](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7409): Display tab's label in small screens


## Highlights

### Improved server-side purging

We have made several improvements to our [server-side purging]({{< ref "apps/guides/performance/purging#server-side" >}}) functionality allowing it to perform better at scale.

- Enhanced logging during purging via a new [`purgelog` document]({{< ref "apps/guides/performance/purging#purged-documents-server-side" >}}) saved in the `medic-sentinel` database after every purge.
- If a contact has more than 20,000 records, it will be skipped and none of its records will be purged.
  - A log will appear for the skipped contact and the id of this contact will be saved in a new `skipped_contacts` property in the `purgelog`.
- The batch size for contacts to purge will dynamically adjust based on the number of records associated with the contacts. 

[#7280](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7280): Server Side Purge does not complete to the end


### Improved login experience

Users who have experienced issues with login should note that this release fixes some bugs. Specifically:
- [#7343](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7343) Deployments using a browser on mobile shouldn't get erroneously logged out.
- [#6338](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/6338) Changes to pseudo-static assets, like images and translations, won't cause unnecessary reloads for app users. 
- [#7187](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/issues/7187) Infinite loops and empty modal boxes at login should not longer be present.
