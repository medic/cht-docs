## Defining Reports

The reports shown in your app are the completed and submitted *forms*. These forms must be defined and included with the application. There are two types of form definitions for reports:
- **App forms**: actions within the app, such as a completed task, or an action on a contact's profile or reports tab. App forms are defined as [XForms]({{< ref "building/forms/app" >}}).
- **JSON forms**: data coming from external channels such as SMS, or via interoperability with other tools. JSON forms are defined using a [JavaScript Object Notation schema]({{< ref "building/reference/app-settings/forms" >}}).
