  Supervision overview

Supervision and workforce management are important aspects to building and maintaining high-performing community health systems. Supervisors help Community Health Workers deliver quality healthcare services to their patients through building CHW care delivery knowledge and skills, fostering a supportive work environment, and supporting continuity of care between home-based care and community health centers or facilities.

The importance of regular and systematic CHW supervision is emphasized by the WHOâ€™s [guidelines](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241550369) on health policy and system support, which is formulated to optimize community-based health worker programs. Following these guidelines, the CHT is designed to enable Supervisors to provide personalized performance feedback during CHW supervision as well as track aggregate statistics. Data collected from completed [Care Guides]({{< relref "building/concepts/care-guides" >}}) produce granular information which can be used to provide coaching that promotes compliance with health program standards of practice and closer monitoring of outcomes.
