The [Community Health Toolkit](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org) is a collection of open-source technologies and open-access resources developed by a community focused on global health equity. We envision a world where primary health care is equitable, accessible, and delivered by people who are trusted in their communities. Start with the [CHT overview]({{< ref why-the-cht >}}), and join our [community forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/)!

## CHT Core Framework
An overview and reference for development of the Core Framework of the Community Health Toolkit. Most CHT App developers are able to build great experiences for their users without extending CHT Core, but you might still find this section useful for its [overview of CHT components]({{< ref "technical-overview" >}}).

{{< see-also page="core" prefix="Read More" >}}

## Designing
An overview of key end user personas, notes on the CHT icon library, and configuration best practices for forms, tasks, targets, and contact profiles. These materials include more detail than you will need when you're just beginning to explore the CHT, but they become increasingly helpful when designing your own community health app for a live deployment.

## Building
Comprehensive reference material on CHT concepts and features, useful for anyone interested in understanding what features and configuration options are available for CHT Apps. This section also includes guides on focused app development topics, and a growing collection of thorough step-by-step tutorials for developing and deploying digital health apps with the Community Health Toolkit. If you're a developer and want to dive right into developing your own app, this is the place to start.
