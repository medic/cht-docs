# Notes:
#  - All software installed below is pinned so they don't get upgraded and break w/o us knowing why.
#  - If you bump one version up to latest, please bump them all so we stay current!
#  - Hugo builds the site twice: once for link checking and once minified for pushing live
#  - Bash script for muffet is intentionally stand alone so devs/content editors can easily run it locally

  push:
    branches:
