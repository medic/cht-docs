Technical organizations
As a technical steward of the CHT, Medic has also established a network of technical organizations which have been onboarded on CHT to enable them to build and support community health information systems independently.
Research initiatives, innovations and studies 
Through the human centered design approach,Medic partners with research institutions and academia to design, test, refine and deploy digital health innovations and carry out research studies.  (Partnership approaches we have used to deploy CHT tools)
